<h2><a name="THE_DINING-ROOM" id="THE_DINING-ROOM"></a>THE DINING-ROOM</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_t.jpg"
    alt="Letter T" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE apartment in which the members of
a family assemble three times a day for
meals must be pleasant. There is a chance
to escape from any other part of the house.
The business man rarely sees his drawing-room
until after the shades are drawn and
the lamps lighted. The wife and mother
divides her time between nursery, sewing-room,
and kitchen, while school-children are
out of the house nearly as much as they are
in it—at least during their waking hours.
But no matter how widely the little flock
may be scattered by their different employments,
always twice and often three times a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
day they are all together in this common
rallying-place of the home.</p>

<p class="i1">Only in the houses of the wealthy, or of
those possessed of exceptionally large dwellings,
is there found a breakfast-room other
than that in which are eaten all the meals of
the family. English mansions frequently
possess both a family and a state dining-room,
and the same custom prevails in some
of the private palaces of our own millionaires;
but in the average American home
one room must do duty for every repast,
whether simple or superb; and in our large
cities this apartment is too likely, alas! to
be situated in the basement.</p>

<p class="i1">The immeasurable superiority of a dining-room
built above-ground over one even partially
beneath it hardly needs demonstration—it
is more cheerful, more airy, and as a
consequence more healthful, better lighted,
of finer proportions, and more susceptible of
effective decoration and furnishing—the advantages
might be continued <i>ad infinitum</i>.
No one who has ever had the pleasure of using
an up-stairs dining-room can contentedly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
descend to one below the level of the street.
Apart from every other consideration, such
rooms are very liable to be damp. It is not
uncommon to have carpets grow musty and
mouldy on their floors, or to find a perceptible
dampness on their walls. These faults
may be to some extent remedied by a layer
of thick felt paper under the carpet, and by
good fires and constant and thorough ventilation.</p>

<p class="i1">A few housekeepers express their preference
for basement dining-rooms because of
the nearness of these to the kitchen, and the
work saved thereby. This is an important
consideration in houses where but one maid
is kept. Her work as cook and waitress is
almost doubled when she has to run up-stairs
to remove the dishes from the dumb-waiter,
and then fly back to her kitchen between the
intervals of waiting on the table. In the
country and in country towns it is the rule
rather than the exception to find the kitchen
in the L, or as an extension, and on the same
floor with the dining-room and parlor, but in
the majority of city houses the apartment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
in which the family gathers at meal-times is
a little below ground. When this is the case,
and when there is no possibility of converting
the back parlor up-stairs into a dining-room
by introducing a dumb-waiter and pantry,
or when expediency or want of space
precludes such a change, the best must be
made of existing circumstances, and the efforts
redoubled to render the despised basement
as pleasant as possible.</p>

<p class="i1">The wall-paper must never be dark in a
room like this, which at the best of times is
never too light. Choose instead a creamy
ground well covered with some small figure,
or, better still, an ingrain paper of a solid
color—a soft gray, a pale green, a cream, or
one of those indescribable neutral tints that
make good backgrounds, and furnish well
but not obtrusively.</p>

<p class="i1">Unless the room is wainscoted with wood,
a very pretty and inexpensive substitute can
be made of India matting, secured at the top
by a narrow band of wood moulding. The
matting can be washed off with salt and water
whenever it needs cleansing. An excellent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
plan is that of having the walls done in
hard finish, and then painting this. The surface
can then be scoured as often as it becomes
stained or specked, and will always
look neat and fresh. An additional coat of
paint can be put on when the first becomes
worn or faded.</p>

<p class="i1">In a rented house the tenants must, of
course, take what they can get, and in many
cases the landlord is unwilling to make
changes. Still, pretty pictures, draperies,
neat furniture, and a well-set table will do
wonders, even for a room that appears unpromising
at the outset.</p>

<p class="i1">It never pays to purchase an expensive
carpet for the ordinary dining-room. Something
durable should be selected, like an ingrain
of a mixed color, or with a minute,
closely-set figure. Better still is a rug, an
art square, or a Smyrna rug, neither of
which is high-priced, while either is satisfactory
both in appearance and in wearing
qualities.</p>

<p class="i1">The floor should be stained or painted,
for a distance of from two to three feet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
from the wall all around the room, in a neat
dark color. Borders of wood-carpeting are
handsome and last a long time, but are costly,
and one does not often find hard-wood
floors in a rented house. The rug may be
either laid loosely or tacked down around
the edges.</p>

<p class="i1">The draperies in a dining-room should not
be heavy. Not only do such darken the
room, but they catch and retain the odors of
food, and hold constantly in their folds depressing
reminders of former feasts. Scrim,
lace, or light Madras or China silk, decorates
the room and softens outlines without impeding
the entrance of light or air. Shades
are essential, and so should be also window-screens
from the appearance of the first fly
in the spring until the last one has vanished
in the fall.</p>

<p class="i1">An open fireplace in a dining-room is unsurpassed
for cheer and comfort there, as it
is everywhere. A screen should always be
in readiness to temper the glow and glare
while the family are at meals. The chimney
is a potent aid to ventilation, and helps to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
disperse those odors that will collect in the
best-ventilated <i>salles à manger</i>, and which
are so appetizing before meals and so unpleasant
afterwards.</p>

<p class="i1">Basement dining-rooms are seldom too
cold. If they are heated by a register or a
stove, or even by a coal fire in the grate, the
constant struggle of the housekeeper is to prevent
their becoming uncomfortably warm.
Vicinity to the kitchen has much to do with
this, and is in summer-time a serious draw-back
to comfort. An equable temperature
must be striven for by frequent airing at all
seasons, and during the heated term by shading
the windows, and by keeping, as much
as possible, the doors shut that communicate
with the kitchen. One advantage at least
is possessed by the basement dining-room in
summer. In common with the cellar, or
with any other partially subterranean chamber,
it is cooler than one that is above ground
and thus unprotected from the hot air without.</p>

<p class="i1">The best method of artificially lighting a
dining-room is hard to decide. Nothing is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
prettier or pleasanter than candle-light, and
it is preferable to gas or lamps in that it does
not heat a room perceptibly. But candles
are expensive, if enough are used to produce
a respectable illumination, and nothing is
more dismal than eating by a dim light.
Good candles are costly, and cheap ones not
only give a poor light, but drip and smoke
and smell, and are otherwise intolerable. A
new style of candle has recently been introduced
which is pierced through its length
with three holes. These tiny pipes are supposed
to carry off the melted wax, and their
advocates claim that these candles will not
drip on the outside.</p>

<p class="i1">Except on state occasions, candles are
barred out for people of moderate means,
and they must have recourse to lamps or
gas. The light should always be suspended
above the table, except, of course, where
candles and candelabra or a tall-stemmed
lamp are used. A side-light does not serve
the purpose of a central one, for some one
must always sit with his back towards it,
and his plate is thus in a perpetual eclipse.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
Pretty hanging lamps come at all prices, but
it never pays to get a cheap one. It may
do very well for a time, but before long the
burner will be out of order; the machinery
by which the wick is turned up or down will
prove refractory, and repairs will do little
good. The only efficient way of mending a
poor lamp is by buying a new one.</p>

<p class="i1">Among the best-known makes of lamps
there is one with a powerful burner which
gives a clear, steady flame, equal to two or
three ordinary gas-jets. The only draw-back
connected with it is the intense heat it radiates,
which makes it objectionable in summer.
Such a lamp costs about seven dollars,
is furnished with a large ground-glass shade,
and supplied with fixtures and a chain, by
means of which it may be raised and lowered
at pleasure.</p>

<p class="i1">Whichever is used, gas or kerosene, the
glare should always be softened by a shade
of some kind. Globes of ground or colored
glass may be used on gas-burners, or, if they
are of clear glass, the light may be subdued
by the Japanese half-shades, which can be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
slipped over the lower half of the globe. A
pretty fashion is that of fastening a Japanese
umbrella, stick upwards, under the chandelier,
although this darkens the table too
much, unless there is a strong light above it.
If any member of the family suffers from
weak eyes, and is distressed by the light that
is none too brilliant for the others, quaint
paper-screen shades, also of Japanese make,
may be hung on the side of the globe towards
the sufferer. The long pliable wires
attached to these shades permit them to be
twisted at almost any angle. Or the fancy
paper screens which imitate roses, pond-lilies,
sunflowers, and the like may be hung on the
globes.</p>

<p class="i1">There has been a good deal of discussion
among furnishers as to what style of picture
should be hung in a dining-room. One declares
that the stereotyped paintings and engravings
of fruit, fish, and fowl are the only
appropriate works of art for this room; while
another argues that it is enough to see the
food in its prepared condition upon the table,
without being forced to contemplate it in its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
natural state upon the walls. The wise
course to follow seems to lie between the
two. Really pretty pictures of game birds
or fish, or of fruit or flowers, are undoubtedly
in their place in a dining-room, but there
is no reason why every other kind of picture
should be excluded. Pastoral or marine
scenes, <i>genre</i> pictures, almost anything except
family portraits, may fitly be placed
there. <i>Their</i> place is in the library, the sitting-room,
or in the large hall, if there be
one.</p>

<p class="i1">Nothing should hang in the dining-room
that is not good of its kind. A cheap chromo,
a poorly executed drawing or water-color,
or an indifferent photograph annoys
beyond words the unfortunate wight who has
to sit opposite it for an hour or two each
day.</p>

<p class="i1">The furniture of a dining-room should be
durable, even if its owners cannot afford to
have it very handsome. Cheap chairs and
table are out of place here. Even those who
cannot afford leather-upholstered chairs and
a heavy mahogany or black-walnut or oak
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
dining-table may get solid, durable substitutes.
Cane seats for the chairs, and an unpolished
top for the table, are better than
showy—and cheap—elegance. A square
table generally allows more space to those
seated about it than does a round one. Almost
any amount of money may be expended
upon a sideboard, but a good one may be
purchased at no great outlay. In addition
to this, if space permits, there should be a
table, with a shelf or two above it, to serve
as a dinner-wagon. This is almost a necessity
when the vegetables are passed instead
of being placed on the table, and it is also
useful for holding relays of clean plates, etc.</p>

<p class="i1">The amount of furniture that is useful and
appropriate in a dining-room is of necessity
limited. Besides the articles already named,
there may be a china press or cabinet, an
easy-chair or two, or even a sofa. The last
is a boon to an invalid or convalescent, who
grows weary of a long <i>séance</i> in a high,
straight-backed chair. The couch may be
forced to serve a double purpose by being
made in the form of a long box, broad and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
low, covered with cretonne, denim, or any
other durable material, and provided with a
hair mattress on the top. When two or three
square pillows are added to this, behold a
comfortable divan, that will at the same time
be a receptacle for the table-linen. Some
such coffer as this is almost a must-have in a
dining-room, unless the china closet is provided
with drawers.</p>

<p class="i1">A wall cabinet for choice pieces of china is
a pretty ornament for a dining-room, and so
is an over-mantel. The latter may consist of
two, three, or more shelves, and should be
solid at the back, as small hooks may then
be screwed in, upon which to hang tea or
coffee cups. These shelves may extend the
full length of the mantel, or occupy only part
of the space. In any case they are excellent
for displaying such pieces of china as one
may not wish to keep concealed in the depths
of a china closet. Nothing very delicate that
will be injured by dust should stand here.</p>

<p class="i1">A corner cupboard adds to the beauty of a
room, and may either be bought ready-made,
or built to fit some especial corner. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
lower part of the cupboard may have a solid
wooden door, while glass doors for the upper
part permit a view of the glass or silver
stored there.</p>

<p class="i1">Blessed is that woman whose house contains
a butler's pantry. Too often the fine
china and glass must either be washed in the
kitchen, or else in a dish-pan brought into
the dining-room. When a pantry is lacking,
there should be a butler's tray to hold the
solid dishes. Such a tray may be closed, and
put out of the way when not in use. A
folding screen covered with Japanese pictures,
with wall-paper, or with some textile
fabric, may conceal the door to the pantry,
or the slide by which dishes enter the dining-room,
or may cut off the corner in which
stands the butler's tray.</p>

<p class="i1">To the woman of quick wit and ready
fingers countless are the opportunities provided
for beautifying her dining-room. She
may drape her mantel and conceal the ugly
marble, using for this stamped Madras, or
silkolene, both of which are pretty and
cheap; she may make covers for her sideboard,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
rich with drawn-work and embroidery;
she may set a box of growing plants in
the window, and tend them, so that she may
always have a vase of fresh blossoms or of
green sprays for the centre of the table; and
she may expend boundless energy in the
manufacture of doilies, tray-cloths, and the
thousand and one dainty pieces of linen dear
to the housewife's soul.</p>

  AT THE BREAKFAST-TABLE</h2>

<div>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">EVERYTHING in reason should be done
to make the breakfast a tolerably pleasant
meal. Very cheerful or jovial it seldom is.
The father is in a hurry to get to his office
or business, and usually buries himself in the
morning paper; the children are burdened
with the thought of approaching school
duties; the mother is silently mapping out
the line of her day's operations, and is disinclined
to conversation. Add to this that all
are apt to be more or less dominated by the
physical depression of tone and passive discomfort
so well known that one judge is
fabled to have refused to ordain capital punishment
for a man convicted of having committed
a murder before breakfast. Until
after that meal, even the best-tempered are
prone to petulance, while those of a taciturn
nature are quiet to the verge of what <i>looks</i>
like sullenness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">Here, as everywhere, upon the mother devolves
the burden of the family well-being.
If her face is cast down and gloomy, its reflection
is seen in the countenances of all
those about her; while if she is bright and
sunny, there is a perceptible rise in the spiritual
thermometer. Only by making a positive
duty of cheerfulness is it practicable
sometimes for the mother to conquer the
weariness and languor, the aching head, and
the loathing for food, that are so frequently
a woman's morning portion. The discomfort
the other members of the family know
is increased tenfold in her case if a restless
child, an ailing baby, or worry over financial
or domestic matters has robbed her of part
of her night's sleep.</p>

<p class="i1">A good deal may be done to create an atmosphere
of pleasantness by due attention
to the condition of the room. Unless it has
been left in spotless order the preceding evening,
either the maid or one of the family
must bestow some attention upon it beyond
putting the breakfast on the table. No
crumbs from the last repast should disfigure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
the carpet; no dust of yesterday's raising
should be thick upon the furniture. The
windows should have been open long enough
to change the air of the room; then, in cold
weather, been closed a sufficient length of
time before the entrance of the family to allow
the atmosphere to become comfortably
warmed. The vase of flowers or the growing
plant that ought to grace the centre of
every table should have a drink of fresh
water, and be ready to do its part in brightening
the board. The table should be carefully
set, the food well cooked, and promptly
served. And, above all, there should be a
sincere and conscientious endeavor on the
part of each member of the household to
sink his own disagreeable feelings, and to
do all in his power to contribute his share
towards the sum total of the family cheerfulness.
Conversation on pleasant topics should
be encouraged, and the items of morning
news distributed to all, not monopolized by
the one in possession of the paper.</p>

<p class="i1">No amount of accustomedness should ever
induce the mistress of the house to condone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
carelessness on the plea that there is no one
present but the family. Just because it <i>is</i>
"only home folks," everything should be at
its brightest. There is no necessity for urging
the parade of pretty china, the preparation
of tempting dishes, when an honored
guest is to be served. Should not even more
pains be taken to have everything attractive
and appetizing when those are to be fed who
have not the charm of novelty to act as
sauce, and to whom the ordinary methods of
cookery may seem stale and hackneyed?</p>

<p class="i1">The table should always appear at its best
at breakfast-time. A colored cloth is economical
as well as pretty, for it does not
show every spot or splash with the readiness
of a white cloth. There is a large variety of
these table coverings from which the housekeeper
may make her selections, ranging in
beauty and price from the plain, comparatively
cheap red cloth with light figures to
the exquisite pieces of fine damask, gorgeous
with embroidery, and with a lace-like border
of drawn-work. For common daily use, the
judicious choice will probably lie somewhere
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
between these, either in a buff, a buff and
scarlet, a buff and blue, or one of the beautiful
Holbein cloths that come, with the
dozen napkins, at about eight dollars the set.
The ground in these is well covered, and
they have the advantage of being nearly as
pretty on the wrong side as they are on the
right. Another recommendation is that they
wear admirably, one at least within the
writer's knowledge having been in constant
use for between four and five years without
showing a sign of old age, except in the thinning
of the fringe, while the body of the
cloth remained without a break. The delicate
tints of the worked pattern will fade
with frequent washing, so that blue and pink
would better be avoided, and the preference
given to the scarlets and buffs, which hold
their own well.</p>

<p class="i1">The cloth is saved by the use of mats under
dishes. Those of straw or wicker-work
are apt to become soiled and stained, and are
not readily cleansed. On the contrary, those
which are knitted, netted, or crocheted may
be washed every week, if necessary. It is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
almost impossible to find a waitress so careful
that once in a while a dish will not be
brought to the table with a black rim on the
bottom, or wet or greasy with something
spilled where it has been standing on the
kitchen-table. Wherever this touches, the
cloth beneath is disfigured, and it is better to
protect it against such misadventures by the
use of mats in the first place than to be
forced to conceal the blemishes afterwards
by "setting the table to humor the spots."</p>

<p class="i1">Worked and fringed doilies are pretty substitutes
for mats, and when there is a cover
of felt on the table under the damask cloth—as
there should always be—they are thick
enough to guard the varnished table-top from
injury from the hot dishes. A carving-cloth
should be spread under the meat-platter, and
will generally by the close of the meal bear
upon its surface eloquent testimony to the
service it has done in saving the table-cloth.</p>

<p class="i1">While it is no sign of stinginess not to
have one's best and most fragile china for
constant use, poor judgment is shown when
only plain heavy white ware is employed for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
the family when they are alone. Decorated
porcelain is cheap nowadays, and makes a
table look extremely pretty. Each one of
the household should have his own especial
oatmeal set, either the bowl, plate, and pitcher,
or one of the deep saucers that come for
this purpose in dark blue and white ware,
with a plate to match, while the cream or
milk may be held for common use in one
good-sized pitcher, to be served by the mother,
or passed to each, as may seem best.
Every tea or coffee drinker should have his
own cup and saucer, and in his imagination
his favorite beverage will taste better from
that cup than from any other.</p>

<p class="i1">There is little chance to make mistakes in
setting the breakfast-table. The hostess has
the tray before her, and serves the tea, coffee,
or chocolate. At the other end of the
table is the principal dish, presided over generally
by the master of the house, while biscuit,
bread, muffins, or griddle-cakes and potatoes
have their posts at the sides. An oatmeal
set stands at each place, accompanied
by the knife, fork, and spoon, tumbler, napkin,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
butter-plate—unless the oatmeal course
is preceded by one of fruit, when fruit plates,
with fruit napkins and finger-bowls, should
hold the first place.</p>

<p class="i1">With the fresh room, the bright cloth, the
shining glass and silver, the vase of flowers,
the appetizing food, one must be either very
dyspeptic or a confirmed pessimist who does
not feel a slight rise of spirits as he takes his
place at the breakfast-table.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">IN the majority of the homes where fruit
is served for breakfast it appears as a
first course. Countless are the headaches to
which this custom has given rise among those
whose stomachs resent the introduction of
the acid as the earliest nourishment of the
day. The choice should always be given
each eater between beginning with fruit or
reserving it as a final course. When it is
served last it acts as a pleasant neutralizer of
the solid or possibly greasy food that has
been already consumed, and sends one from
the table with what children call "a good
taste" in the mouth.</p>

<p class="i1">The habit of eating some cereal for breakfast
is happily becoming almost universal.
There are comparatively few households in
which porridge of one sort or another does
not appear on the breakfast-table, and it is
usually relished by both children and elders.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
It need not be always of oatmeal. There
are numerous varieties of cereals in the
market at present, and an occasional change
will prevent any one's wearying of the
wholesome dish. With cracked wheat, cerealine,
wheat-germ meal, wheatena, wheat,
oat, and Graham flakes, corn-meal mush,
hominy boiled plain, hominy boiled in milk,
and a number of others to choose from, there
is no reason why any one should have occasion
to complain of monotony. Cream adds
greatly to the toothsome qualities of any one
of these preparations, and may usually, even
in the city, be procured in sufficient quantities
to allow a modicum for each of the elders.
The healthy appetites of the children rarely
need this encouragement.</p>

<p class="i1">The tea should always be made on the
table when it is possible, as by this means
there need be no doubt that the water used
in its concoction is actually boiling. The
"loud-hissing urn" is a decided addition to
the beauty and brightness of the table, especially
when the "urn" is in the form of a
pretty brass or copper kettle, swinging from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
one of the tall cranes known as a "five-o'clock
tea." Some people prefer making
the coffee on the table too, and this is possible
when a Vienna coffee-pot or a French
drip coffee-pot is used. The only trouble is
that the coffee in the latter pot is apt to cool
before it has stood long enough to extract
the full strength of the berry.</p>

<p class="i1">The tea-cozy should never be lacking, and
it is not a bad plan to have a similar wadded
cap with which to cover the coffee-pot. One
of the prettiest and best kinds of tea-cozy is
the covered Japanese basket with a thick
stuffed lining, in which the china teapot is
set. These are not costly, and will outwear
the ordinary cozy made of silk, woollen, or
chamois-skin. When the lining of the basket
is worn out, it may easily be renewed.</p>

<p class="i1">The substantial part of our American
breakfast is not marked by much variety.
At nearly all of them will be found the steak,
chops, or cutlets, varied once in a while by
fish, a hash, or a stew, semi-occasionally by
a dish of eggs. Potatoes in some form—stewed,
baked, boiled, or fried—are in order,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
and these are flanked by a plate of hot biscuit
or muffins, or oftenest by successive instalments
of griddle-cakes.</p>

<p class="i1">There is no use in adding further to the
diatribes that have been written and spoken
against the American breakfast. Such as it
is, it appears to be here to stay, and it is a
waste of time, breath, and energy to attempt
a radical reform. All one can hope to do is
possibly to modify it, and lighten its sameness
by suggesting dishes that may please
the palate and not impair the digestion.
The adoption of the Continental breakfast
has been vainly urged, and it is an open
question whether or not the habit ever survives
transportation. The American climate
and mode of life differ so much from those
of the Continent that other fashions must be
followed here than those which prevail there.
Many families, who during a long foreign
residence have found quite sufficient for their
matutinal meal the coffee or chocolate, the
rolls and butter, possibly supplemented by
fresh eggs or a little marmalade, have conscientiously
endeavored to pursue the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
custom upon their return to this country.
In not a single case within the writer's cognizance
has the attempt proved other than a
failure, recognized as such at the end of a
few months. <i>Autre pays, autres mœurs.</i></p>

<p class="i1">While the children are still young, the entire
family usually breakfasts together. The
obligation upon the younger members of
reaching their schools at a given hour forces
them to be on time, although there are homes
in which the wretched practice is observed
of permitting the school boys and girls to
rush in at the last moment and gulp down a
few mouthfuls, hurrying off to their recitations
after having thus successfully sown the
seeds of future dyspepsia. As the sons and
daughters grow into manhood and womanhood,
they drift more and more into unpunctual
habits. The breakfast-table is left
standing well on into the middle of the
morning, and sundry <i>plats</i> are kept hot in
the oven for Mr. Jack or Miss Mamie, who
has been out late the night before. Often
the demands of business require the young
man to be down in season, but there are no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
such claims obliging his sister to quit her
couch at a—to her—unseasonable hour. As
a consequence, what should be one of the
family gathering-places becomes little better
than a hotel breakfast-room, where the guests
come and go as suits themselves. Besides all
other considerations, the work of the servants
is increased, and their own duties are
crowded out by the necessity of being in
readiness to serve these tardy ones.</p>

<p class="i1">At the first glance it may seem harsh to
exact the prompt appearance at the breakfast-table
of the girl who has danced until
after one o'clock in the morning, and whose
head has not touched her pillow until an
hour or two later. But the habit of self-indulgence
fostered by such concessions, does
the girl no good. Is it any harder for her
to rise betimes than it is for the weary mother,
whose domestic cares forbid her lying in
bed? Does not this indolence to a certain
degree unfit the daughter for the duties that
will devolve upon her when she in turn becomes
a wife and mother?</p>

<p class="i1">One sensible matron, who still held the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
reins of family government as firmly when
her children were grown as when they were
first short-coated, always insisted on promptness
at the breakfast-table. "Human beings
are gregarious," she would say, "and they
should eat together. If you are tired and
sleepy, take a nap later in the day, but be on
hand at breakfast-time."</p>

<p class="i1">Of course there may be exceptions to this
rule, and here the maternal judgment must
appear. More privileges can be allowed to
the delicate, nervous girl, than to the strong,
robust one; but then the former should avoid
late hours and dissipation. An occasional
morning nap does no harm; but there is little
rhyme or reason in permitting the young,
healthy members of the family to be the lie-abeds.</p>

<p class="i1">Without encouraging any disposition to
"finicalness" concerning food, special attention
should be paid to individual preferences
in catering for the family breakfast. Children
are apt to take whims, and these should
not be fostered; but when either a child
or an older person has a decided distaste for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
some article of food, he cannot be forced into
a fondness for it. Better is it to humor his
idiosyncrasies by preparing something that
he will eat. In a private family it may be
out of the question to cook a separate breakfast
for each one, but a little forethought
will enable the housekeeper to so arrange
her <i>menu</i> that every one will have at least
one dish to his or her taste. This is not a
difficult matter, unless there is the unusual
combination of a large family and very distinct
preferences. Generally there is so much
in common that trifling varieties in the bill
of fare will accommodate each person.</p>

  THE INVALID'S BREAKFAST</h2>

    alt="Letter F" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">FOR the invalid there is often no possibility
of the slight stimulus to appetite produced
by the change of air from one room to
another. Breakfast, the hardest meal of the
day to many well people, is doubly difficult
to one who must eat it in the same room where
she has spent the night—perhaps many nights—of
feverish restlessness, that has given her
a detestation of the bed, the bedroom, and
everything connected therewith, chiefest of
all being the disgust with herself, the weary,
distraught being with aching limbs, heavy
head, and ill-tasting mouth.</p>

<p class="i1">When feasible, the invalid should be taken
from bed to eat her regular breakfast, previously
strengthening her by a cup of beef-tea,
of chicken or oyster broth, or a glass of
hot milk, or of hot milk and seltzer. First
of all, however, the face and hands should be
sponged off in tepid water and dried quickly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
and the mouth well rinsed out. Then, refreshed
and stimulated by this and the warm
draught, a little more elaborate toilet may
be made, always allowing a few moments
for the settling of the stomach after the food
before the dressing begins. A more thorough
bathing, a combing of the hair, a change of
linen, the slipping on of a warm dressing-gown,
and the moving to another couch or
an easy-chair will not be a prolonged piece
of work if the attendant is quick and deft,
and has everything in readiness for bath and
toilet.</p>

<p class="i1">A great advantage is gained when the invalid
can be wheeled or supported into another
room, and have a completely changed
air and scene in which to take her meal. But
when this is impracticable the room should
be well aired before the patient is taken out
of bed, and as soon as she is established on
her couch or in her chair, and this placed as
far as possible from the bed, the covers of
this should be stripped off and carried from
the room. Every piece of cast-off linen, every
receptacle containing soiled water, everything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
that recalls the fact that this is a sleeping-room
and that can be removed, should be
banished. A screen should be set between
the patient and the bed, and if the chamber
still seems close, she should be bundled
up while another draught of fresh, pure air
is allowed to rush into the room. After
all this, when a table bearing an attractive
breakfast is moved to the invalid's elbow,
she is usually quite ready to partake
of it.</p>

<p class="i1">In many cases it is out of the question for
the patient to leave her bed, and then the
coaxing of the appetite is a more difficult
task. The very fact of being in bed seems
to render eating almost an impossibility to
some people. The woman who complained
petulantly that everything she ate in bed
tasted of the blanket and pillows, only voiced
the sentiments of a multitude of her sisters.
Among some women, breakfast in bed is esteemed
a luxury; but it is one thing to take
it there from choice, and quite another to be
forced to do so by weakness or ill-health.
Still, with due care, it may be made less distasteful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
than would seem practicable at the
first glance.</p>

<p class="i1">The preliminary sponging, mouth-washing,
and hot drink should take place in this as in
the other case. Then, after a brief rest, during
which the windows should have been
opened for a few minutes, and closed long
enough to allow the room to regain a comfortable
temperature, the task of rearranging
the bed and its occupant should be begun.
Clean linen and pillows should be at hand,
and the patient be sponged off, have her hair
combed, be arrayed in another night-dress,
moved to the other side of the bed, and provided
with a fresh pillow, as expeditiously
yet gently as may be. Then, when the soiled
clothing has been removed, the room been
once more aired and warmed, the patient
may be raised on pillows and her breakfast
brought to her. There is an admirable little
table which may be arranged above the patient's
knees, and is a great comfort to any
one compelled to take her meals in bed for
any length of time.</p>

<p class="i1">Nothing should be left untried to render
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
the invalid's breakfast tempting. The tray
should be covered with a spotless cloth, the
china, silver, and glass should be of the best
the house affords, and the same napkin should
never be offered a second time.</p>

<p class="i1">The tea or coffee cup and the egg-glass
should be filled with boiling water, that they
may not cool what is put into them. A pretty
little pot should hold the tea or coffee, and
there should be a tiny cream-jug and sugar-bowl.
A vase containing a few flowers, preferably
those without a heavy perfume, should
grace the tray, and in the preparation of
the food every evidence should be given of
the loving thoughtfulness that has left unsought
no means of lightening the discomfort
of the sufferer. Where there is no bed-table,
there should be another tray, smaller
than that in which the breakfast is brought.
This may then be placed on a stand or chair
beside the bed, while the other holds the cup
or plate upon the patient's lap. A large napkin
or clean towel should always protect the
bedclothes from food that may possibly be
spilled upon them, for few things are more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
unpleasant to a sick person, especially to
one afflicted with a squeamish stomach,
than the sight of a spot of egg, coffee, or
grease on sheet or spread. When such an
accident occurs, the stained article should
always be promptly exchanged for a fresh
one.</p>

<p class="i1">The meal over, every vestige of food and
every reminder of the repast should be at
once removed, the patient's face and hands
again sponged off, the pillows shaken and
turned, and the invalid's position changed.
Should any odor of food remain, the room
may once more be aired.</p>

<p class="i1">Peace and quiet must reign while the invalid
eats. If visitors are to be admitted it
must not be at that time. Only one or possibly
two members of the family, and those
the quietest ones, may be present, and the
conversation must be pleasant and cheery.
No distressing topics must be broached, no
references except encouraging ones made to
the invalid's state of health. In the delicately
balanced condition of nerves which
generally afflicts a sick person, very little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
will serve to upset the equilibrium and to
effectually banish appetite.</p>

<p class="i1">All that love's ingenuity can suggest
should be done to provide a variety of food
for the invalid. After a little while she usually
tires of what impatient men, under similar
circumstances, stigmatize as "slops," and
wearies for something more substantial and
appetizing than gruels, broths, and soft toast.
In those cases where solid food is forbidden
by the physician, catering is more difficult,
but often a convalescent is permitted to eat
a greater variety of food than is offered her.
Cream soups, clear soups, broiled birds, a
bit of tenderloin steak, a lamb chop, a tiny
baked omelet, raw, stewed, and roast oysters,
broiled and fricasseed chicken, poached
and soft-boiled eggs, a bit of venison, dishes
of rice, sago, and tapioca, jellies, custards,
blanc-manges, fruits, plain ice-cream—there
is almost no end to the dainty <i>menus</i> that
can be arranged. Every meal should be a
surprise; there should be no discussion in
the invalid's presence of what she can eat,
although every reasonable wish she expresses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
for any article of food should be gratified, if
feasible. The sick one's lot is hard enough
at the best, and no expedient should be left
untried to ameliorate it.</p>

<h2><a name="A_BREAKFAST-PARTY" id="A_BREAKFAST-PARTY"></a>A BREAKFAST-PARTY</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_l.jpg"
    alt="Letter L" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">LARGE breakfasts, or <i>déjeûners à la fourchette</i>,
are not a very common form of
entertainment in this country, and yet they
may be made charming. Unlike luncheons,
where there are usually only women present,
both men and women may be invited to a
breakfast. The hour is usually twelve, although
it may be a little earlier or later. One
o'clock is the latest hour which it is advisable
to set for a breakfast.</p>

<p class="i1">The number of guests invited is optional,
but a small party, consisting of from six to
twelve, is pleasanter than a crush. Indeed,
unless one has an exceptionally spacious <i>salle
à manger</i>, it is difficult to accommodate comfortably
more than a dozen guests, and an
over-crowded table is always unpleasant.
The writer preserves a vivid memory of a
dinner she once attended where fourteen
people were packed about a table of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
proper size for ten guests. There was hardly
room for the waiters to pass the dishes
between the <i>convives</i>. Each one elbowed
his neighbor, and what might have been a
delightful repast became a struggle at close
quarters with the difficulties of getting
through the courses without nudging his
next companion, knocking over his glass, or
materially interfering with his eating.</p>

<p class="i1">At a ceremonious breakfast the table
should be spread with a handsome breakfast
or lunch cloth, either of pure white, hem-stitched
or adorned with drawn-work, or one
containing more or less color. If the table
is very handsome, the cloth may be left off.
The floral ornamentation is less formal than
at a dinner. There may be a bowl of flowers
in the centre of the table, but quite as
pretty as this are three or four graceful vases
scattered here and there, each holding a few
choice blossoms, and supplemented, if the table
is large, by a few tiny globes or little
dishes filled with short-stemmed flowers that
look well, massed, like pansies, violets, primroses,
etc., mixed with plenty of delicate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
feathery green. If a central ornament for
the table is desired, there is nothing prettier
than a wicker or metal basket filled with
growing ferns, grasses, or lycopodium, with
possibly one or two plants in bloom among
them.</p>

<p class="i1">In setting the table for a large breakfast,
a plate, napkin, water-glass, and a butter-plate
holding a tiny pat or ball of butter, are
laid at each place, and a salt-cellar also, if
individual salts are used. At the right of
each plate is the silver butter-knife, and one
other knife; to the left is the fork. The
taste of the hostess must decide the point of
placing more small silver than is needed at
each course by the plates when the table is
first spread. Laying it all at once saves
waiting, but some good authorities ordain
that a waiter should bring in a fresh knife
and fork with each course for each guest,
while others, equally reliable, advocate placing
the knife and fork upon a cold plate in
front of each person at the beginning of
every course. The guest instantly removes
them, and a hot plate is substituted by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
waiter for the cold one before the next dish
is passed. This system involves much additional
waiting, and should not be attempted
unless an exceptionally well-trained butler is
in charge.</p>

<p class="i1">The little dishes of bonbons, <i>marrons</i>, and
<i>glacé</i> fruits that are always <i>en règle</i> at a
luncheon should not appear on the breakfast-table.
There may, however, be olives, radishes,
and salted almonds placed here and
there.</p>

<p class="i1">The first course should consist of fruit.
The plates, holding each its doily, finger-bowl,
fruit-knife, fork, and spoon, may be on
the table when the guests enter the room, or
be put there as soon as they are seated. The
variety of fruit offered must be decided by
the time of year. When they are in season,
nothing could be more delicious than big
strawberries, served uncapped. These may
be passed in a dish, and each guest allowed
to help himself. Sugar into which to dip the
berries may then be served to each. Prettier
still is it to place in front of each guest
a plate bearing a tiny decorated basket filled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
with the berries. The sugar may be in tiny
individual sugar-cellars or be passed in a
bowl. Unless the berries are fine large ones,
it is better to serve them hulled, and to eat
them with sugar and cream. In that case
they are eaten from saucers.</p>

<p class="i1">Peaches, pears, apricots, nectarines, etc., in
summer, and oranges, apples, mandarins, bananas,
and the like in winter, all add greatly
to the beauty of a breakfast-table when they
are garnished with leaves and heaped upon
a large flat salver, or in a cut-glass bowl, or
an open-work one of china or silver.</p>

<p class="i1">After the fruit may come a course of oysters
cooked <i>à la poulette</i>, broiled, steamed,
panned, or in croquettes. For these may be
substituted lobster or crab in some form, if
preferred, or both the oysters and the other
may be served in successive courses. Next
may come some such <i>entrée</i> as sweetbreads
roasted, broiled, fricasseed, or in <i>vol-au-vent</i>
with mushrooms, or chickens may be served
in some such dainty form as <i>pâtés</i>, <i>timbales</i>,
<i>à la marengo</i>, or <i>au suprême</i>. Next are
chops, cutlets, or small beef tenderloins, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
potatoes in some fanciful style. There should
be no other vegetable. French bread or rolls
must be passed frequently.</p>

<p class="i1">The next course may consist of a game
pie, either cold or hot, or of boned fowl, and
may be followed by a salad. The name of
these is legion, but the plain lettuce salad is
better reserved for dinner, and in its stead
at breakfast there may be served something
like tomatoes and lettuce with mayonnaise
dressing, celery mayonnaise garnished with
radishes, and accompanied by crackers and
cheese, or a fruit-salad of oranges, grape
fruit, or pineapple.</p>

<p class="i1">The dessert may be of any cold sweets,
and if ices are used they should be of the
punch order—one of the many varieties
known as Roman, Siberian, creole, cardinal,
etc. If crackers and cheese are not served
with the salad, they may be passed at the
close of the breakfast. Brie, Gorgonzola, or
Roquefort may be used.</p>

<p class="i1">At a breakfast of ceremony the tea or coffee
tray is never placed on the table, but
breakfast coffee or cocoa is served in large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
cups after the fruit, and is passed by the butler,
instead of being poured by the hostess.
Tea may also be offered. Wines are not
strictly <i>selon les règles</i> at a breakfast, although
occasionally claret is served about
the middle of the meal.</p>

<p class="i1">The waiting at such a breakfast as this is
about as ceremonious as it would be at a
luncheon. No large dishes are placed on the
table, but everything is passed by the butler
or waitress. Each dish may go the rounds,
and the guests be allowed to help themselves,
or a plate containing a portion may be placed
by the butler in front of each person. The
guest always helps himself to cheese and
<i>hors-d'œuvres</i>, but the ices are served separately
on plates. <i>Bouquets de corsage</i>, <i>boutonnières</i>,
cards and <i>menus</i> are not necessary
at a breakfast.</p>

<p class="i1">A wedding breakfast is conducted on much
the same line as that described above, except
that there are usually fewer hot and more
cold dishes served, such as salmon, lobster,
or chicken <i>à la mayonnaise</i>, boned turkey
and chicken, <i>pâté-de-foie-gras</i>, jellied tongue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
and fowl, and a greater variety of such sweets
as creams and jellies. Wines, too, are quite
<i>comme il faut</i>.</p>

<p class="i1">The giving of a breakfast need not be a
matter of dread to the hostess who has confidence
in her cook and waitress. The <i>menu</i>
suggested may be so modified or increased
as to make it as simple or as elaborate as
preference may dictate. A breakfast is a
pleasant style of entertainment, for, while
both sexes are admitted, as at dinner, there
is not the formality of dress essential at that
meal, the men appearing in morning coats,
and the women in handsome high-necked
and long-sleeved house or calling costumes.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">WHILE the principal features of the
home breakfast remain essentially the
same throughout the year, variety is gained
by adapting the different articles of food to
the season of the year in which they are
served. A lighter, less carbon-producing
diet is not only more agreeable, but more
healthful, in warm weather than one containing
much animal food, while the latter
is preferable and almost necessary in winter.
To this consideration is added the eminent
propriety of making one's bills of fare
seasonable, and thus achieving fitness and
economy.</p>

<p class="i1">With the desire to aid the housewife in
her labors, a few selected <i>menus</i> for each
meal and each season will be given, none of
them too costly to be beyond the reach of
people of moderate means, and appended to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
each bill of fare will be recipes for the preparation
of certain dishes therein mentioned
which may possibly be unfamiliar to the
readers of these chapters.</p>

<p class="ac">1.<br />
Oranges.<br />
Cracked Wheat.<br />
Parsley Omelet. <span class="padl-1">Corn Muffins.</span><br />
Buttered Potatoes.<br />
Tea. <span class="padl-2"> Coffee.</span></p>

<p class="i1"><i>Parsley Omelet.</i>—Five eggs, two tablespoonfuls
milk, one tablespoonful butter,
one tablespoonful finely minced parsley;
pepper and salt to taste. Beat the whites
and yolks of the eggs separately and very
light; add the milk to the yolks and stir in
the whites, not mixing them in thoroughly,
however; season to taste. Pour into the
omelet pan in which the butter has been
heated, and set over the fire in a moderately
hot spot. Keep the omelet from adhering
to the pan by slipping a knife between them
from time to time. Just before the omelet
is "set," sprinkle it thickly with the chopped
parsley. When done, fold one half over the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
other, slip to a hot dish, and serve at once,
as it falls quickly.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Corn Muffins.</i>—One and a half cups flour,
one and a half cups yellow corn-meal, three
tablespoonfuls sugar, two tablespoonfuls butter,
two eggs, one and a half cupfuls milk,
two teaspoonfuls baking-powder, half teaspoonful
salt. Sift the salt and baking-powder
with the flour; beat the eggs light; add
the milk, the butter (melted), and the sugar.
Stir in the flour and meal; beat hard, and
bake in muffin-tins.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Buttered Potatoes.</i>—Slice cold boiled potatoes,
heat them in a steamer, thence transfer
them to a hot dish. Put on them a large
tablespoonful of butter into which have been
worked a teaspoonful of chopped parsley and
a saltspoonful of lemon juice. Set the dish,
covered, over hot water for two minutes, and
serve.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Creamed Cod, with Potatoes.</i>—To two cupfuls
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
of boiled cod, salt or fresh, well picked
to pieces, allow one cupful of mashed potato.
Season to taste. Put into the frying-pan over
the fire with a half-cupful of milk and a large
tablespoonful of butter. Stir and beat constantly
while it heats, and soften it by adding
to it boiling water at discretion. When
a creamy, smoking mass, transfer it to a
hot dish. If you have drawn butter in the
house, or <i>sauce tartare</i>, or egg sauce left over
from the first appearance of the fish, this
may be used in place of the milk and butter.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Griddle Muffins.</i>—One egg, one tablespoonful
butter, one cupful milk, one teaspoonful
baking-powder, pinch of salt, flour
enough to make a soft dough. Mix the milk,
beaten egg, and melted butter together; sift
the baking-powder and salt into one cupful
of the flour; then add the rest; roll out the
dough as thick as for biscuit, cut into rounds
with a biscuit-cutter, and bake slowly on a
griddle, turning when done on one side. Tear
open, and butter while hot.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">AS the season advances and the warm
weather becomes settled, the preference
should be given to fish and egg dishes rather
than to those containing meat. For a sultry
morning a breakfast of which fruit makes an
important part is welcome generally to both
palate and digestion.</p>

<p class="i1">The many kinds of delicious fresh fish that
may easily be procured should hold a prominent
place in summer bills of fare; while
eggs, usually plentiful and cheap at this
season, may be prepared in various tempting
fashions.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Strawberries.</i>—When served as a first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
course at breakfast, it is better to have
them unhulled, and to eat them with the
fingers, dipping each berry into powdered
sugar.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Moulded Cerealine.</i>—Prepare the cerealine
as usual the day before, and fill small cups
with it. Turn it out the next morning, and
eat cold, with cream.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Rye Gems.</i>—Three cups rye-flour, three
cups milk, three eggs, one tablespoonful
sugar, one tablespoonful butter. Beat hard

<p class="i1"><i>Shad Roes in Ambush.</i>—Two shad roes,
four hard-boiled eggs, one cup milk, one tablespoonful
flour, two teaspoonfuls butter;
pepper and salt to taste. Lay the roes in
boiling water, and let them simmer for ten
minutes. Drain this off, pour cold water
upon them, and let them stand in this for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
ten minutes; then take them out, and set
them aside until wanted. Separate the
whites and yolks of the boiled eggs, chop
the whites coarsely, and rub the yolks
through a sieve. Make a white sauce by
heating the milk and thickening it with the
butter and flour rubbed together. Rub the
shad roes to pieces with the back of a spoon,
taking care not to crush the eggs too much.
Stir them into half of the white sauce, season,
let them stand on the fire long enough
to be heated through, and pour into a pudding-dish.
Mix the whites of the eggs with
the rest of the sauce, and cover the shad roes
with this; last, strew the powdered yolks
over the top. Cover closely, and set in a hot
oven for three minutes.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">DURING the early part of the autumn,
and indeed until late in the winter, the
supply of fruit is only less abundant than in
the summer. Melons and peaches go first,
but their place is taken by grapes, pears, apples,
bananas, and, later, mandarins, tangerines,
and oranges. Meat now begins to be a
more necessary article in the bill of fare. By
the exercise of a little ingenuity, left-overs
from the dinner of the previous day may be
rendered even more appetizing than they
were in their first estate.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Maître d'Hôtel Butter.</i>—Into one cupful

juice and two tablespoonfuls of finely

chops, steaks, or cutlets, or to mix with potatoes.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Potatoes hashed with Cream.</i>—Chop cold
boiled potatoes fine, and stir them into a
cup of hot milk in which has been melted

<p class="drop-cap">A WORD may be said here anent the cooking
of porridges. There are as many
theories about this apparently simple affair as
there are denominational differences in theological
circles. One housekeeper soaks the
oatmeal overnight; another puts it on when
the fire is made; another fifteen minutes before
breakfast. Mrs. A. soaks hers in cold
water, Mrs. B. uses boiling, while Mrs. C. inclines
to having the water just hot. One
stirs the porridge frequently; another says it
is ruined if touched with a spoon.</p>

<p class="i1">On general principles, one may say that
oatmeal is never the worse for a soaking, although
some varieties need it less than others;
that unless carefully and evenly cooked
it is apt to become lumpy without stirring
or beating; and that the degree of stiffness
to which it should be brought must depend

<p class="i1"><i>Sausage Rolls.</i>—Make a good pastry by
chopping into two cups of flour four tablespoonfuls
of butter, making this to a paste
with half a cup of ice-water, and rolling out
three times. Have the ingredients and utensils
very cold, and handle the paste as little
and as lightly as possible. Cut the pastry
with a sharp knife into strips about three
inches square. On one of these lay cooked
and minced sausage-meat, and cover it with
another square of the same size. Pinch the
edges together, and bake in a moderate oven.
Proceed thus until all the materials are
used.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Rye Muffins.</i>—One cup white flour, two
cups rye flour, two eggs, two teaspoonfuls
baking-powder, one tablespoonful butter, one
tablespoonful sugar, saltspoonful salt, milk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>

salt, half yeast-cake dissolved in warm
water. Warm the milk; beat in the salted
flour, the melted butter, and the yeast. Let
this sponge stand in a warm place until light.
Bake in greased muffin-rings on a hot griddle,
or in muffin-pans in the oven. In either
case fill the pans or rings only half full, as
the crumpets will rise in baking.</p>

fine; tiny bit of onion, scalded and chopped;
half teaspoonful parsley; one cup milk, or
half milk, half soup stock; one tablespoonful
flour; one tablespoonful butter; pepper
and salt to taste; one egg. Cook the butter
and flour together until they bubble; pour
the milk or milk and stock on them, and stir
until they thicken. Remove from the fire, and
pour upon the beaten egg; then stir in the
meat, seasoned with the onion, parsley, pepper,
and salt. Set this aside until cold enough
to handle, then form into croquettes between
the floured hands. Roll in egg, and then in
fine cracker crumbs, and drop into boiling
lard. They are better prepared an hour before
frying.</p>

<p class="i1">In making veal croquettes, oyster liquor
may be used in place of the stock, and a few
oysters chopped with the veal will improve
the flavor.</p>

<h2><a name="AT_LUNCHEON" id="AT_LUNCHEON"></a>AT LUNCHEON</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_p.jpg"
    alt="Letter P" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">PROPERLY treated, luncheon may be the
pleasantest meal of the day. Simple
or elaborate, as the housekeeper's taste may
dictate, always informal, it is more comfortable
than the breakfast because less hurried,
more agreeable than the dinner because less
ceremonious.</p>

<p class="i1">The table at luncheon may either be set as
for breakfast, with a pretty colored cloth to
cover it; or a prettier way, if one has a table
with a handsome top, is to spread on this a
large luncheon napkin that only partially conceals
the polished surface. One or more of
these napkins may be used, according to their
size and the amount of space you wish covered.
A fringed doily or a crocheted or netted mat
may be laid at each place to protect the table-top
from the heated plate. Other mats
should be laid under the hot dishes of meat,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
etc., while a tile or a trivet will hold the
chocolate or teapot.</p>

<p class="i1">A writer on household decoration in a recent
article in a popular magazine enlarged
upon the charming effect produced by painting
a table-top white, and thus producing a
good background upon which to display old
blue-and-white china. This would doubtless
be extremely pretty, but in the practical
mind the suspicion arises that, by the time
the bare white table had held hot dishes during
half a dozen meals, its surface would be
marked with yellow rings that would leave
no choice to the housewife but to conceal the
whole of the defaced expanse with a table-cloth.
A good furniture polish, or a simple
mixture of sweet-oil and turpentine, applied
with a piece of flannel, will restore the beauty
of a hard-wood table-top, but it is questionable
if the white paint could be so readily
renovated.</p>

<p class="i1">The flowers that should have freshened the
breakfast board must not be lacking at luncheon-time.
The table may be spread with a
luncheon set of china, or, if one does not own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
this, with the same plates, etc., that are used at
breakfast and at tea. The tea-tray, with its
burden of sugar-bowl, cream-pitcher, tea-caddy,
and dainty cups and saucers, may stand
in front of the mistress of the house, while at
her elbow may be the five-o'clock-tea crane
bearing its kettle of boiling water; or a smaller
hot-water urn in brass, copper, or silver,
with a spirit-lamp under it, may be on the
table near her right hand, with the teapot
beside it. If the small hot-water pot is used,
and the table is bare, a tray should hold the
kettle and stand, lest a drop of blazing alcohol
should blister the polished surface of the
wood. When cocoa or chocolate is drunk at
luncheon, the paraphernalia of kettle and
spirit-lamp is, of course, unnecessary.</p>

<p class="i1">There are some brands of cocoa for which
it is claimed by the manufacturers that they
are excellent when prepared for use by simply
pouring the boiling water on the powder.
So far as the writer's experience has gone,
however, there is not one of them that is not
benefited by being boiled for a few minutes
before serving.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">Nearly everything that is to compose the
ordinary luncheon for the family may be put
upon the table at one time. Of course there
must be an exception to this rule when the
first course consists of soup or bouillon; but
even then all the cold dishes may be in place
when the guests are seated. The waiting
need be only of the simplest, unless formality
is desired. Those about the table may help
themselves and one another, while the duties
of the waitress may be confined to passing
the dishes that are on the sideboard, changing
the plates, bringing in hot dishes, etc.</p>

<p class="i1">The truth, often reiterated, that women
cook only for men, and that a woman would
never take the trouble to prepare anything
for herself beyond a cup of tea and a slice of
toast, is strongly emphasized by the carelessness
many of them manifest in the matter of
luncheon. Of course, when there are several
in the family the needs and tastes of others
have to be consulted; but when the mistress
of the house has to sit down to a solitary
meal, or at best to one that is the nursery
dinner for two or three children whose diet is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
of the simplest, she is apt to let her luncheon
consist of little more than a "cold bite," and
the—almost—invariable cup of tea. Such a
course must affect the health sooner or later,
and is a species of carelessness of self against
which a woman must guard if she does not
wish to reap its fruits in headaches, dyspepsia,
and general depression of the system.
Without getting up a troublesome <i>menu</i>, she
may yet devise divers tempting little dishes
which will coax her appetite. She will feel
happier and work better for a substantial although
not heavy meal in the middle of the
day.</p>

<p class="i1">Luncheon is pre-eminently the meal at
which to make use of potted meats, sardines,
<i>pâtés</i>, and the like. There are many of these
from which to make a choice. A luncheon is
not to be despised that begins with a cup of
bouillon, or with a plate of soup left over from
last night's dinner, continues with fresh rolls
or biscuit or muffins, or toasted crackers, or
good cold bread—white or brown—cut in
delicate slices, and one of the <i>pâtés</i> put up
by certain French and American companies,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
or a Gotha liver sausage, or a few sardines,
accompanied by a cup of tea or cocoa, and
concludes with some simple sweet, such as
marmalade, jam, or fruit.</p>

<p class="i1">But luncheon need not be confined to cold
delicacies that must be bought outright. It
is the time for using up left-overs, for trying
new recipes for side-dishes and <i>entrées</i>, for
the housekeeper to learn for herself and to
teach her cook the daintiest methods of utilizing
those remnants which the uninitiated
might stigmatize as "scraps." Great is the
variety of styles in which these may be employed.
That bit of cold fish from last evening's
dinner may be picked to shreds, stirred
into a white sauce, and baked in a scallop-shell.
Or it may be mixed with half as much
mashed potato, moistened with boiling water
and a little melted butter, and tossed up into
a dish of creamed fish.</p>

<p class="i1">The scraps of pastry left from pie-making
and the sausage or two that were spared at
breakfast may compose a sausage-roll, the
cold potato and the fragment of steak may
be turned into a hash, and odd slices of cold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
lamb, mutton, or veal are just the thing for
croquettes and fritters. And of the odds and
ends of poultry what delicious compounds
may be made! Croquettes, scallops, minces,
fritters, filling for <i>pâtés</i>, salad enough for one
or two if eked out with lettuce, and a dozen
other dainty <i>plats</i>. Or a tiny omelet, either
baked or <i>sauté</i>, may be prepared; and when
one begins to count up the appetizing dishes
which may be made of eggs, the list seems
without an end. Even when several people
are to partake of the meal a variety of little
dishes may take the place of a single large
one for which new material would have to be
purchased. In the cultivation or creation
of a talent as a <i>réchauffeuse</i> true economy
consists.</p>

<p class="i1">In some homes luncheon is a quite elaborate
affair, and comprises several courses, including,
perhaps, a soup or bouillon, a meat
course, a salad, and fruit or sweets. In the
majority of establishments owned by people
of moderate means, however, the meal is
simpler, but need be no less delightful. Many
people can eat muffins, griddle-cakes, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
other hot breads at noon with less after-discomfort
than at any other season, and dishes
of this sort are usually acceptable on the
luncheon-table. With their help the meal
can hardly fail to be appetizing.</p>

<h2><a name="A_SMALL_LUNCHEON" id="A_SMALL_LUNCHEON"></a>A SMALL LUNCHEON</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_l.jpg"
    alt="Letter L" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">LUNCHEONS are among the most popular
forms of entertainment that can be
selected, when only a limited number are to
be honored. To these affairs men are seldom
invited, and there are not wanting those
among the sterner sex who do not hesitate to
attribute their banishment to desire on the
women's part for the opportunity to chat uninterruptedly
and unreservedly on those subjects
presumed dear to their hearts—dress,
babies, and servants. Other men go so far as
to hint that gossip, and even scandal, engage
the tongues of these much-maligned women,
while even the most charitable husbands and
brothers cannot refrain from openly expressing
their pity for the unfortunate ladies debarred,
for even a limited period, from the
delights of the society of the lords of creation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">Casting aside the intimations respecting
gossip or scandal as unworthy of notice, and
tracing the animus of the other slurs to their
source, in the overpowering jealousy on the
part of their perpetrators that they are excluded
from the select assemblages they affect
to condemn, it may be said in refutation
of the last charge that there are few women
who do not agree in considering a luncheon
among the most delightful of their social experiences.
An invitation to one is usually
hailed with joy, and a woman will undergo a
good deal of inconvenience sooner than consent
to decline it.</p>

<p class="i1">A luncheon is elastic in its nature, and may
be of any size the hostess's fancy or judgment
dictates. One woman may invite another
to share the meal with her, and to help
form that <i>solitude à deux</i> so delightful to two
congenial souls. In such a case a long and
elaborate <i>menu</i> is out of place, and not in the
best form. What dishes there are should be
wisely selected, perfectly prepared, and carefully
served; but a multiplication of courses
or viands is unnecessary, and savors of vulgar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
display. The same principle applies at any
<i>small</i> luncheon. The definition of size is a
rather difficult matter, but a company of this
sort of not more than five or six persons may
fitly be called small. With every addition
to the number the need increases for more
items in the <i>menu</i>.</p>

<p class="i1">For a small and unpretentious luncheon
the invitations should not be issued long in
advance, unless the hostess finds it necessary
to do so in order to secure the presence of
some especial guests. In that case, if the
entertainment is to be very simple, it is as
well to inform the guests of the fact when
writing to them. Either a written or a verbal
invitation is admissible. It should always
be clearly understood, however, that
the engagement, when once made, is no less
binding than if it were a promise to attend
the largest and most ceremonious dinner.
Indeed, fidelity to one's acceptance and
prompt attendance are even more obligatory
at a small than at a large affair, because at
the latter the defection of one person is less
noticeable than it would be were very few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
expected to be present. In either case failure
to keep the engagement is a grave breach
of etiquette. It may be said, in this connection,
that more of a compliment is implied
by the request to be one of a small and—by
inference—select band than is shown when
the invitations embrace a larger party.</p>

<p class="i1">An even number is usually better than an
odd number at a luncheon, unless the table
is a large round one, about which the guests
can gather without leaving an awkward gap
on one side.</p>

<p class="i1">The covering for the table may either be a
very pretty luncheon cloth with a little color
about it, or else of plain white. Of course,
should the hostess desire to have any one
tint predominate in her table appointments,
it is better to have the cloth of that shade
or of white. If artificial light is required,
candles give a pleasanter light than anything
else, and one candelabrum of several branches
is generally enough for a small table.
Should this not sufficiently illuminate the
room, the gas may be lighted and partially
turned down, or a lamp or two may be placed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
on a mantel-shelf or on a bracket. There
should always be flowers in the centre of the
table, preferably a flat or low dish or vase,
for where there are few guests they should
be able to see each others' faces, instead of
being obliged to dodge around a tall ornament
that effectually conceals those seated
on one side of the board from those placed
on the other. <i>Bouquets de corsage</i>, while always
pretty, are not essential at a simple
luncheon, nor are cards necessary.</p>

<p class="i1">The table should be spread with the daintiest
china and silver. At each plate must
be the usual articles—knife, fork, tumbler,
butter-plate, and napkin. A knife and fork
for each course may be laid by every plate,
the knives on the right side, the forks on the
left. A roll or two or three sticks of bread
must lie on each napkin. The usual little
dishes of olives, salted almonds, pea-nuts or
pistachio-nuts, radishes, bonbons, etc., should
stand here and there, and by their color or
sparkle add to the beauty of the repast.</p>

<p class="i1">The first course may be either beef or
chicken bouillon. This is served in bouillon-
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>cups,
with covers and saucers, if one has
them, or, if not, in tea or after-dinner coffee-cups.
The latter are a trifle small, but one
need not go to the other extreme, as was
done at a lunch given not long ago, where
the bouillon was served in <i>mugs</i> nearly as
large as those commonly used for shaving,
and quite as thick and heavy. It was impossible
to help recalling the saying of the
woman who declared that when she took
coffee from one of the breakfast cups in
use at most hotels she felt as though she
were drinking it over the side of a stone wall.
Bouillon is usually sipped with a spoon, however,
although it is not out of the way to
raise the cup to the lips.</p>

<p class="i1">The bouillon may either be on the table
when the guests enter the room, or be
brought in as soon as they are seated. It is
followed by fish in some dainty form, as
creamed fish, creamed or buttered lobster,
croquettes of lobster, oysters, or fish; or oyster
or lobster <i>pâtés</i>. These are not passed in
the dish, but are brought in already served,
and a plate holding a portion placed in front
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
of each guest. Rolls, French bread, or bread
and butter are then passed.</p>

<p class="i1">The next course in a luncheon of this size
need not be an <i>entrée</i>, although one may be
introduced here. Sweetbreads, chicken cutlets,
<i>timbales</i> of some sort, a <i>vol-au-vent</i>—any
one of these will answer, but there is no violation
of rules if it is omitted altogether at a
<i>small</i> luncheon. In that case the next course—the
<i>pièce de résistance</i>—may follow the fish
directly, and may consist of French chops
with pease, and potatoes daintily prepared, or
chicken broiled, fried, or cooked in some
attractive fashion, or broiled tenderloins of
beef with mushrooms, or birds.</p>

<p class="i1">After this the salad appears, and may be
of chicken, lobster, shrimps, oysters, or tomatoes,
avoiding, of course, any meat or fish
that has appeared earlier in the meal, even
although in another form. The olives should
be passed with this, and, indeed, may have
gone the rounds during and between the
other course, as have the salted nuts and the
radishes.</p>

<p class="i1">The salad eaten, the table is cleared and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
crumbed, and the dessert brought in—ices in
some pretty form, accompanied by fancy
cakes. Fruit may succeed this, or it may be
omitted, and the final cup of chocolate or coffee
served at once. The bonbons now receive
attention, and are usually carried into
the drawing-room by the guests, who, being
women, seem to find almost as much enjoyment
in nibbling these as men do in discussing
their post-prandial cigars.</p>

<h2><a name="A_LARGE_LUNCHEON" id="A_LARGE_LUNCHEON"></a>A LARGE LUNCHEON.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_a.jpg"
    alt="Letter A" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A MUCH more ceremonious affair than
that described in the preceding chapter
is the large luncheon, where there are present
anywhere from eight to twenty guests. The
invitations for this are issued at least ten days,
and often three weeks or more, previous to
the date for which the guests are asked, and
should be written, not verbal, except when
given to an intimate friend. The recipient
should reply at once. The hour set is usually
one or half-past one, and the most punctilious
promptness should always be observed.
Nothing short of a serious accident or illness
or a death in the family can justify any one
in breaking such an engagement.</p>

<p class="i1">"People don't always keep that precept,"
says a woman, decidedly. "I can give more
than one example to the contrary from my
own experience. Here is an instance. I had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
a letter not long ago from a friend living out
of town, begging me to fix a time when she
could come and see me. She dreaded making
the trip into town when it was doubtful
if she would find me at home. I knew she
had few outings, so I wrote and asked her to
lunch with me upon a certain day, adding
that there would be a couple of other old
friends present whom she would be glad to
meet again. The appointed day came, and
was misty and drizzly. It never occurred to
me that the weather would keep any one
housed, and at the lunch hour 'the guests
were met, the feast was set'—or, at least,
two of the guests were there—but the one in
whose honor they had been invited failed to
appear. A whole mortal hour did we wait
for that woman. Then in despair we sat
down to a luncheon that had been in no ways
improved by the delay. It was to have been
a <i>partie carrée</i>, and one side of the table
looked wofully blank and bare."</p>

<p class="i1">"But did you not get a satisfactory explanation
of your friend's absence?" queries
an interested listener.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">"Only a note the next day, stating that as
it had stormed, she had supposed I would
not expect her. It never seemed to occur to
her that she ought at least to have telegraphed."</p>

<p class="i1">"I had an experience that equals that,"
chimes in another. "I had promised a young
girl friend a lunch party whenever she should
come to the city. Just before the holidays
she wrote to me that she would be in town
for a week. I was run to death with Christmas
preparations and social engagements, but
I sent her a note at once, asking her to fix a
day for her luncheon, and enclosing the list
of guests—most of them old school friends—whom
I would invite to meet her. She replied,
setting a day. I went to no end of trouble
and expense to get up the most <i>recherché</i>
luncheon I could devise. Just before the appointed
hour one of the guests, who had
promised to call for my young friend and
bring her to my house, brought instead a verbal
message that Jennie 'was not very well,
and would be unable to come. She was extremely
sorry,' etc. As I learned from another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
source that she went to the theatre that
night, I concluded her indisposition, whatever
it was, had not been very serious."</p>

<p class="i1">One marvels at the bad habits of good society
in hearing such tales as these, but they
are unfortunately common. Some persons
appear to be deficient in a sense of good-breeding,
as others are in an eye for color or
an ear for music, and all the maxims in the
world seem inadequate to instil what is missing.</p>

<p class="i1">One general principle may be laid down
for the following of any woman who thinks
of giving a large luncheon—<i>don't undertake
too much</i>. If you cannot afford to engage
the most difficult dishes from a caterer, be
very sure that your cook is equal to preparing
them in a satisfactory manner. Better
have a few things, and have them well done,
than a long <i>menu</i> of indifferently cooked viands.
A large luncheon is no light undertaking
at the best, except to those who have
a practised <i>chef</i> and an expert butler, and a
great deal of personal supervision is required
to make it a success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">If the number of guests is larger than can
be conveniently accommodated at one table,
two or three smaller ones may be used. One
table is rather prettier, however, as it admits
of concentrating, instead of scattering,
the decoration. The cloth should be white,
or something very handsome in colors. A
centre-piece of velvet or plush or satin, or of
linen, embroidered, painted, done in cut-work
or drawn-work, or something else
equally elegant in material or ornament,
should be laid down the middle of the table.
An exquisite centre-piece may be made of
bolting-cloth, hand-painted and trimmed
with lace. On this a mirror is often placed,
bearing the bowl, basket, or jar of flowers.</p>

<p class="i1">Tall candelabra should hold enough candles
to light the room well, and each candle
should have its tiny paper or silk shade and
its glass <i>bobèche</i>. If the gas must be used, it
should be shaded. The dishes containing <i>hors
d'œuvres</i>—bonbons, <i>glacé</i> fruits, etc.—must
be many, and their contents of the choicest.</p>

<p class="i1">The arrangement of silver, glass, and china
may be the same as at a small luncheon, except
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
that the amount of silver at each place
must be increased. The bread sticks on
every napkin must be tied with a narrow
ribbon matching the broad one that ties the
<i>bouquet de corsage</i> provided for the guest.
Cards bearing the names of the guests indicate
their seats, and may be either hand-painted
or plain. Favors are often given,
and should be placed on the table before the
luncheon is announced.</p>

<p class="i1">Oyster or Little Neck clams compose the
first course, and are followed by bouillon.
Fish succeeds this; then comes one <i>entrée</i>,
and sometimes two. Next is a dish of meat,
with one or more vegetables, and then the
Roman punch appears.</p>

<p class="i1">After this, game comes, and then salad.
The table then being cleared, pastry in some
form, or Charlottes or jellies are brought in,
and this course in turn is succeeded by ices
in pretty or fanciful shapes. An attractive
caprice is that of ices or cream in the form
of fruits heaped up in and rolling out of a
basket of clear ice or spun sugar placed on a
salver. Ices in small goblets or tumblers of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
clear ice are often served. The fruit comes
next, and is accompanied by bonbons, <i>glacé</i>
fruits, <i>marrons</i>, and the like. Last are coffee
and chocolate.</p>

<p class="i1">Of the following <i>menus</i>, either one is suitable
for a large luncheon:</p>

<p class="ac">1.<br />
Raw Oysters.<br />

<p class="i1">With either of these <i>menus</i> wine may be
served, although there is not the variety of
these at a ladies' luncheon that there is at a
dinner. Claret may be served with the fish
or first <i>entrée</i>, and drunk during the luncheon,
or brought in with the game, or with the
heaviest meat course. In some cases no
claret is served, and the only wine is the
small glass of sherry offered late in the meal.</p>

<h2><a name="A_STANDING_LUNCH" id="A_STANDING_LUNCH"></a>A STANDING LUNCH.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_f.jpg"
    alt="Letter F" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">FOR a long time there was a felt need for
some form of entertainment that would
be more general in its character than a dinner
or a lunch, less of a full-dress affair than an
evening party, and more elaborate than the
ordinary kettle-drum or afternoon tea. This
want was finally supplied by the introduction
of the standing lunch, which is in reality little
more than a regular reception, such as
usually takes place in the evening, held in
the afternoon. To this both ladies and gentlemen
are invited.</p>

<p class="i1">The hours for which the guests are asked—usually
from four to six or seven—preclude
the necessity of full dress. The men usually
wear morning coats, while the women are
arrayed in handsome calling costumes, and
do not remove their bonnets. It may be remarked,
<i>en passant</i>, that the wearing of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
hat or bonnet is, or should be, a rule without
exception at a ladies' lunch. Only the hostess
or those of the company who are guests
in the house appear with their heads uncovered.
The others wear handsome dressy
bonnets, such as they would assume for the
theatre in the evening or for an afternoon
reception.</p>

<p class="i1">The hostess who desires to entertain her
friends or to discharge her social obligations
by a standing lunch must issue her invitations
some days in advance of the date fixed. They
should be formal, and are usually engraved,
although they may be written. The former
method is preferable.</p>

<p class="i1">At a lunch of this kind, as the name implies,
the guests are not to be seated at
one large table, nor even at a number of
small ones. The large dining-room table
and sideboard are set out with a repast consisting
of some hot and some cold dishes.
The guests move about the drawing-room,
seating themselves if they have the chance,
as they would at an evening reception, and
are served with plates containing the successive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
courses, either by waiters or by their
escorts. Not only is there less formality in
the conduct of the guests than would be
observed at an ordinary luncheon, but there
is also less precision in the serving of the
refreshments.</p>

<p class="i1">For such a lunch the hostess does well
when she provides a number of camp-chairs
in addition to the seats she already has in
her rooms. It is always more agreeable to
eat when one is seated than when standing
and endeavoring to handle a full plate and a
brimming coffee-cup at the same time. Such
an effort is severe even for a man, who has
been obliged to practise it all his life, but it
is doubly distressing to a woman, who is in
constant terror lest an unguarded movement
on her own or her neighbor's part should
cause an upset and a spill that might fatally
damage at least one gown, and possibly
more.</p>

<p class="i1">In preparing for a standing lunch, or for
any other large reception, it is prudent for
the hostess to clear her parlors of such breakables
as statues, tall vases, piano lamps, etc.,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
that rest upon pedestals or easily overturned
stands. These, if not taken from the room,
should be moved into corners where they
will be comparatively safe from injury;
while the largest pieces of furniture, such
as sofas or lounges and big easy-chairs,
should be wheeled back near the wall, so
as not to interfere with the movements
of people through the rooms. Light chairs
should stand about here and there, and
the camp-chairs should be stacked in some
convenient closet or in the corner of the
hall, whence they can be produced at a
moment's notice when the refreshments are
served.</p>

<p class="i1">The floral decorations may be either simple
or ornate, according to the wishes of the
hostess. Mantels banked with flowers,
chandeliers and brackets draped with smilax,
a profusion of roses, and baskets of choice
cut flowers are very beautiful, but the rooms
can be rendered attractive by less costly
means. If there is to be a large number of
guests, the flowers will be unnoticed by
many of them unless judgment be shown in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
the disposition of vases. These should be
placed on the mantels, on brackets, on the
top of the piano, or in some other place
where they will be seen readily, rather
than on low tables, where they are not
only hidden, but are in imminent danger
of being knocked over. Palms or ferns in
pots and other growing plants decorate
pleasingly, and can be engaged for the evening
from a florist, if the mistress of the house
neither owns them nor feels inclined to buy
them.</p>

<p class="i1">In preparing the dining-room table it
should be drawn out to a size that will permit
of its holding without undue crowding
the dishes and plates that will be required
for the lunch. If the refreshments are too
numerous to be accommodated here, the
sideboard should be cleared for their reception,
and even one or two side-tables
brought in. The table should be spread
with a long white cloth. A bowl or jar or
pot of flowers may be in the centre of the
board. Very elaborate floral arrangements
are unnecessary in the dining-room, unless a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
good many of the guests are expected to
come out here.</p>

<p class="i1">At each end of the table and at intervals
along the sides spaces should be left for the
dishes that are to hold the refreshments.
Between these may be the piles of plates and
the napkins. These may either be separate
or arranged together, a napkin being laid on
each plate and all placed in piles, so that
they may be easily distributed. Forks and
spoons should also be close at hand, with the
necessary utensils for serving the different
dishes, that there may not be a hurried search
for a carving knife or fork or a large spoon
just at the last moment, when its presence
might have saved delay and confusion.</p>

<p class="i1">The side-table should hold the coffee and
chocolate cups, the wineglasses, goblets, or
tumblers for water, etc. Let it be seen, by
the way, that there is plenty of iced water in
readiness. Many a guest at a large reception
has longed for a drink of it and found it
apparently the hardest thing to get which he
could have selected.</p>

<p class="i1">Unless the hostess has a remarkably well-
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>trained
butler, and one or two other servants
who understand waiting, she will be wise if
she engages hired waiters to take charge of
the serving of the dishes, and has her butler
and maids confine their services to passing
plates in the drawing-room. This is pleasanter
than having the outside helpers waiting
on the guests, while their skill and practice
in serving render them most efficient in
the work of filling plates.</p>

<p class="i1">The first course of a standing lunch is usually
bouillon, served in cups. When these
have been removed, a plate is brought to each
guest containing oysters in some shape, usually
fricasseed or creamed, and accompanied
possibly by a lobster croquette or a sweetbread
or mushroom <i>pâté</i>. The third course
may comprise chicken croquettes or rissoles,
accompanied by lettuce or celery salad.
Both with this and the preceding course tiny
square or three-cornered sandwiches of thin
bread and butter, spread with some potted
meat or fish, with sardines, or with lobster
mayonnaise, may have been passed. After
this course come the sweets—ice-creams or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
ices in small shapes, biscuit in paper cases,
and fancy cakes—followed by coffee or chocolate.
Nothing must be served that cannot
be easily eaten with a fork or spoon. Light
wines or a bowl of punch are always in
order.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_LUNCH_BASKET" id="THE_LUNCH_BASKET"></a>THE LUNCH BASKET.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_t.jpg"
    alt="Letter T" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">TO many people the lunch basket and its
contents are quite as important as any
regularly set-out meal of the day—more important
than such occasional luxuries as ceremonious
<i>déjeûners à la fourchette</i> and standing
lunches.</p>

<p class="i1">Among this number are not only the
school-children who, five days out of the
week, must carry what the Southern boys
and girls would term a "snack" with them
to school, but also the army of men and women
whose employment takes them to such
a distance from their homes that it is impracticable
for them to return there for the
midday meal. With these must not be forgotten
the band of night workers who, in one
capacity or another, have part in making the
morning papers, and who, turning day into
night, find it as essential to take a midnight
as others do a midday repast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">In a less degree interest is felt in the lunch
basket by those young people who regard
the coming of the summer chiefly as the return
of the picnic season. All these desire
to know of something appetizing to supply
their needs, and nearly all agree in condemning
certain articles as stale and hackneyed,
asserting that they are tired to death of
them. Among these are generally ham and
tongue sandwiches.</p>

<p class="i1">In making suggestions on this subject, the
first thing to be considered is the basket, and
to begin with, it <i>should</i> be a basket, and not
a close tin box or pail that cannot be sweetened
except by scouring and scalding between
the times of using. A basket, by permitting
the passage of air through its interstices,
prevents the food acquiring a close, musty
taste; and even the basket should have frequent
airings and sunnings, and an occasional
plunge into hot salt and water, followed
by a rinsing in fresh hot water, and a wiping
and drying in the sun or near the fire.</p>

<p class="i1">Only fresh napkins must be used for wrapping
about the lunch, and if their use proves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
too severe a strain upon the linen drawer,
Japanese paper napkins may be substituted,
or even fresh white tissue-paper, or druggist's
paper. The daintiness of ribbons to tie the
different parcels is all very pretty, but it is
hardly possible for the hurried house-mother
who has to put up even one lunch a day,
much less when she has two or three to prepare.
In order to succeed in making them
even ordinarily attractive, she must take
thought for these lunches as carefully as she
does for the other meals of the day, and
make provision accordingly, not waiting until
the last moment, and then hastily gathering
up whatever odds and ends she can find,
and hurriedly cramming them all together
into the basket in a manner that savors unpleasantly
of the bestowal of "broken victuals"
and cold bits upon the beggar at the
kitchen door.</p>

<p class="i1">Not until she gives the matter serious
thought does the housewife appreciate what a
variety she can select for the lunch basket of
her boy or girl, or of her husband. Hot
foods are out of the question, of course, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
even hot drinks, unless a tiny alcohol "pocket
stove," filled and ready for lighting, and a
tin or agate-iron cup, accompany the outfit.
In that case, many a hot cup of <i>café au lait</i>
or chocolate, of soup or bouillon, may be enjoyed
by the luncher.</p>

<p class="i1">But even when this cannot be managed,
cold coffee and tea are not to be despised,
while cold bouillon is preferred by many to
the hot beef tea. Or, for a change from this,
a small flask of milk or of lemonade may be
carried. In any case the bottle should be a
stout one, and provided with a good stopper,
that no break or leakage may cause the ruin
of the rest of the refection.</p>

<p class="i1">China makes the lunch basket too heavy,
and takes up too much room. If a plate is
required, let it be one of the little wooden
butter plates that can be thrown away after
using. It is often possible to procure a glass
from which to drink, but even when it is not,
a flat glass or a collapsing cup may easily be
carried in the pocket; or an ordinary flask,
having a cup fitted to the bottom, may be
purchased and kept for service in the lunch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
basket. A tiny cruet for salt and another
for pepper should also be part of the outfit.</p>

<p class="i1">Often it does not seem to occur to the housekeeper
that it is quite practicable to carry a
cup custard, a baked apple or pear, a tiny
mould of jelly or blanc-mange, as well as uncooked
fruit. While the latter is always
wholesome and generally popular, there are
times when one wants something else. To
paraphrase Miss Woolson's words in "For the
Major," "A large cold apple on a winter day
is not calculated to arouse enthusiasm."</p>

<p class="i1">Other dainties are easily prepared. Every
one who has read "Little Women"—and who
has not read it?—will remember Meg and Jo
March trudging off to their work on frosty
mornings, each carrying the turnover that
was to compose her lunch, and gaining comfort
for the cold fingers from its warmth.</p>

<p class="i1">A tiny pie baked in a saucer, a small tart,
a diminutive rice or tapioca pudding in a
patty-pan, are not hard to make, and are a
welcome variety at the midday "snack."</p>

<p class="i1">While it might possibly be an expensive
item to provide potted meat for sandwiches
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
for every day in the week, there are often
odds and ends that, with a little "doctoring,"
may be made into excellent substitutes.
The meat on the drumstick left from the
roast or stewed chicken of last night may be
chopped fine, moistened with a little gravy
or melted butter, seasoned, and spread on
thin slices of buttered bread. The bit of
steak that clung to the bone may be minced,
and have stirred into it a little Worcestershire
sauce and a suspicion of made mustard;
while the slice of cold lamb or veal, also
minced, may be flavored with curry-powder
and softened with melted butter to make
filling for sandwiches.</p>

<p class="i1">The one or two cold sausages left in the
pantry will make an appetizing sandwich
when crushed fine with the back of a spoon,
and laid between the two sides of a buttered
roll or biscuit; while the last spoonful of lobster
or chicken salad scraped from the bottom
of the dish may be spread on buttered
bread for yet another kind of sandwich.</p>

<p class="i1">White, Graham, brown, or whole-wheat
bread may be used in turn, with an occasional
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
roll or biscuit to still further vary monotony.
Egg sandwiches, cheese sandwiches, sweetbread
sandwiches, sardine sandwiches, minced
ham, tongue, ham and chicken, chicken and
bacon sandwiches—their name is legion.</p>

<p class="i1">But some one may object, one does not
want <i>all</i> sandwiches. True enough, but they
are the <i>pièce de résistance</i> of the lunch. They
may be supplemented, however, by a piece of
cold fowl, by, once in a while, a broiled bird,
by a few pickled oysters, by deviled and
plain hard-boiled eggs, by salads without
number, by olives, cheese, and pickles. And
for desserts are there not the little dishes already
suggested, to say nothing of cake, cookies,
ginger-snaps, apples, oranges, mandarins,
bananas, pears, grapes, and other fruits? For
school children there are such simple dainties
as bread or rolls spread with jam, jelly,
marmalade, or apple-sauce. And are not
crackers and cheese always at hand, and almost
always popular?</p>

<p class="i1">While all this may at first seem to impose
additional labor upon the housekeeper, she
will soon find, when the habit is once established
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
of providing regularly for the lunch,
that she feels it no more of a burden than
she does to cater for the other meals of the
day. Let her keep on the alert for new fancies,
and they will come to her more rapidly
than she can utilize them.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THESE <i>menus</i> for simple home lunches,
given as were those for breakfasts—ten
for each season—are not designed to serve as
exact guides, but merely as suggestions to
the housekeeper. They may easily be improved
upon or altered. To some they will
doubtless appear much too simple, while others
may condemn them as being too elaborate.
Certain selected recipes will accompany
them.</p>

<p class="ac">1.<br />
Baked Cheese Omelet. <span class="padl-1"> Toasted Crackers.</span><br />
Strawberry Jam.<br />
Cocoa.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Baked Cheese Omelet.</i>—Two eggs, two cups
milk, one small cup grated cheese, one small
cup fine bread-crumbs, salt and Cayenne pepper
to taste, one tablespoonful melted butter.
Soak the crumbs in the milk, in which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
you have dissolved a <i>tiny</i> pinch of soda; beat
the eggs light, and add to the bread and
milk; stir in the butter, the seasoning, and,
last of all, the cheese. Bake in a well-greased
pudding-dish, and eat at once, before it falls.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Toasted Crackers.</i>—Split and toast Boston
crackers. Butter them well on the inside,
lay the two halves together, and serve them
in a hot covered dish. They are not nearly
so good when they are cold.</p>

<p class="ac">2.<br />
Ham Fritters. <span class="padl-1"> Baked Bananas.</span><br />
Bread-and-Butter.<br />
Ginger Snaps.<br />
Tea.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Ham Fritters.</i>—Two cups minced cold
ham, one egg, half-pint good stock, saltspoonful
dry mustard, teaspoonful Worcestershire
sauce, tiny bit of scalded onion (chopped),
half-teaspoonful minced parsley, one
tablespoonful butter, one teaspoonful flour.
Heat the stock to boiling, and thicken it with
the butter and flour rubbed together; stir
into it the ham, seasoned with the mustard,
onion, Worcestershire sauce, and parsley;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
add the beaten egg. Pour the mixture on
a flat plate to cool. When cold and firm,
make into flattened balls about the size
of a small plum; drop each into a batter
made of a cup of flour, two teaspoonfuls of
melted butter, a small cup of warm water,
the beaten white of an egg, and a little salt.
Lay each fritter out of the batter into boiling
fat. They will puff up at once, and
should be of a delicate brown.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Baked Bananas.</i>—Select large ripe bananas,
and bake them in the oven as you would
potatoes. When the skin begins to split at
the seams they are done. Take them out,
and serve one to each person, as a vegetable.
They should be peeled, and eaten with butter
and a little salt.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Bread-and-Butter.</i>—Butter bread a day
old on the loaf, and cut into thin slices.
Double, the buttered side inward.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Ginger Snaps.</i>—Two eggs, two cups sugar,
one cup butter, two teaspoonfuls ginger, one
teaspoonful cinnamon, flour to make a stiff
dough. Roll into a thin sheet, cut into
rounds, and sprinkle with granulated sugar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
before baking. Watch closely or they will
burn.</p>

<p class="ac">3.<br />
A Scrap Hash. <span class="padl-1"> Rice Bread.</span><br />
Oranges.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>A Scrap Hash.</i>—Two cups cold beef (roast,
boiled, corned, or fresh), one or two cold
sausages, two or three slices cold bacon, one
cup cold potato, four olives, tablespoonful
Worcestershire sauce, a little cold stewed tomato
(if you have it), half an onion minced
fine, one cup gravy or soup stock, <i>or</i> one cup
boiling water and a tablespoonful of butter.
Heat the gravy or stock to boiling in a frying-pan;
stir into it the other ingredients
chopped <i>fine</i>; simmer for fifteen minutes,
stirring constantly. You can either serve
the hash soft or let it brown on the bottom.
Olla-podrida though it seems, it will be savory,
and will be relished by nearly every one.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Rice Bread.</i>—Two cups milk, two cups
boiled rice, one cup white corn-meal, three
eggs well beaten, two tablespoonfuls butter,
teaspoonful salt. Bake in a hot oven, in
rather shallow pans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

Stewed Pie-plant.<br />
Light Cakes.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Liver Toast.</i>—One cupful cold boiled or
stewed liver, half cupful brown gravy of any
sort, enough mustard, salt, pepper, and Worcestershire
sauce to season the liver highly,
several squares of buttered toast. Rub the
liver smooth with the back of a spoon, add
the seasoning, heat to boiling with the gravy,
and heap or spread upon the toast. Set
in the oven two minutes before sending to
table.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Rusk.</i>—Two cups milk, two eggs, two and
a half cups flour, half cup butter, one cup
sugar, half a yeast-cake dissolved in warm
water. Set a sponge made of the milk, the
yeast, and part of the flour—enough to make
a good batter. Let this rise all night. In
the morning work in the beaten eggs, the
sugar, butter, and the rest of the flour.
Knead well, and make into balls with the
hands. Set these together in the pan, let
them rise until light, and bake in a steady
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
oven. Just before taking them out brush
the tops with molasses and water.</p>

<p class="ac">5.<br />
Panned Oysters. <span class="padl-2"> Lunch Biscuit.</span><br />
Stewed Prunes.<br />
Ginger Snaps.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Panned Oysters.</i>—Cut small rounds of toast
to fit the bottom of deep, straight-sided patty-pans.
Prettier than these are the little "nappies,"
or china fire-proof dishes, that come
for this purpose. Moisten each piece of toast
with a spoonful of oyster liquor, lay on it
as many oysters as the pan will easily hold,
sprinkle with pepper and salt, lay a small
piece of butter on top, and set in the oven
for a few minutes until the oysters begin to
crimp. Serve in the pans.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Lunch Biscuit.</i>—Two cups flour, half cup
milk, one egg, one tablespoonful butter, one
tablespoonful baking-powder, saltspoonful
salt. Chop the shortening into the salted
flour, pour in the beaten egg and milk, making
a soft dough, roll out, cut into rounds, and
bake.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Deviled Mutton.</i>—Rub slices of rare mutton
with a mixture made as follows: One
teaspoonful Worcestershire sauce, one teaspoonful
vinegar, one teaspoonful made mustard,
tablespoonful melted butter. Let the
meat lie in this for an hour. Then dip each
slice in a frying batter made as directed in

fat. Or the deviled meat may simply be
boiled over a clear fire. In either case serve
very hot.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Hot Loaf Bread.</i>—Set a loaf of French
bread in the steamer for fifteen minutes, then
in a hot oven for five minutes. Serve wrapped
in a napkin, and cut on the table.</p>

Scalloped Cod. <span class="padl-2"> Oatmeal Gems.</span><br />
Boiled Potatoes.<br />
Guava Jelly and Crackers.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Scalloped Cod.</i>—Two cupfuls picked codfish,
one cupful drawn butter (with an egg
beaten in it), one teaspoonful minced sour
pickle, one tablespoonful Worcestershire
sauce, fine bread-crumbs. Have the drawn
butter hot, stir the fish into it, add the
pickle and sauce, pour into a buttered baking-dish,
sprinkle with crumbs, dot with bits
of butter, and bake.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Oatmeal Gems.</i>—Two cups of the finest
oatmeal, two cups milk, two eggs, one tablespoonful
butter, one tablespoonful sugar, one
saltspoonful salt.</p>

<p class="ac">9.<br />
Scrambled Eggs with Asparagus. <span class="padl-1"> Bread and Butter.</span><br />

  FAMILY LUNCHES FOR SUMMER</h2>

<div>

    alt="Letter I" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IN hot weather a comfortable room is essential
to the enjoyment of a meal. The
<i>salle à manger</i> must be cleared of food, the
soiled dishes removed, all crumbs brushed
up, and the flies beaten out the moment
breakfast is over, if the apartment is to be
pleasant at noon. If blinds and doors are
kept closed, the room may be deliciously
cool and fresh by lunch-time.</p>

<p class="i1">With such surroundings, good digestion is
much more prone to wait on appetite than
in a stuffy, fly-infested room, where neither
heat nor light is excluded. Among the pleasantest
recollections of at least one woman
are those connected with the lunches she
has eaten in midsummer in a certain city
dining-room, where the subdued light, the
daintily arranged table, the carefully prepared
and seasonable food, and the noiseless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
serving inclined one to feel that there were
many worse fates than being obliged to spend
the summer in town.</p>

<p class="ac">1.<br />
Anchovy Toast. <span class="padl-1"> Chicken Salad.</span><br />
Bread-and-Butter.<br />
Berries and Cream.<br />
Iced Tea.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Anchovy Toast.</i>—Spread crustless slices of
toast first with butter, then with anchovy
paste. Set in the oven five minutes, and
send to table.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Chicken Salad.</i>—Cut into small neat pieces
half the contents of a can of boned chicken
or part of a cold boiled or roast chicken.
Mix this with half as much celery, if you can
get it; if not, arrange it in the midst of crisp
lettuce leaves. Stir into it a French dressing
of two tablespoonfuls of oil, as much vinegar,
and a little pepper and salt, and pour over it
a mayonnaise dressing.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Mayonnaise Dressing.</i>—Into a bowl set in
an outer vessel of cold or iced water place
the yolk of an egg. Be careful that no vestige
of the white gets in. Begin whipping
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
in salad oil drop by drop with a Dover egg-beater,
beating for nearly a minute after
each addition. After ten minutes, add two
or three drops at a time, and when the dressing
once begins to thicken, the quantity can
be increased even more. If too thick, add a
little vinegar to thin it. A pint of oil can
be used to every egg. When done, season
with salt and white pepper. Just before
serving, stir into it the whipped white of an
egg. The bowl, egg-beater, and materials
must all be very cold, and the dressing when
made must be kept on ice until used.</p>

Eggs <i>à la Crème</i>.<br />
Raw Tomatoes. <span class="padl-1"> Rice Crumpets.</span><br />

<p class="i1"><i>Eggs à la Crème.</i>—Eight eggs boiled hard,
one cup white sauce, two tablespoonfuls fine
crumbs, tablespoonful butter. Slice six of
the eggs, and put them in a pudding-dish
with the white sauce. Rub the yolks of the
other two eggs through a sieve, mix them
with the bread-crumbs, and sprinkle them
over the top of the dish. Put bits of butter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
here and there, garnish the dish around the
sides with points of buttered toast and the
extra whites of the eggs cut in rings, and set
the dish in the oven until browned on top.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Rice Crumpets.</i>—One cup rice, two cups
flour, one cup milk, one tablespoonful butter,
one tablespoonful sugar; quarter of a yeast-cake,

with the sauce described in the last chapter
(see "Deviled Mutton"), and broil over a
clear fire.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Broiled Tomatoes.</i>—Slice, but do not peel,
fresh tomatoes. Broil them on a toaster
over the fire; remove to a hot dish; put a
little butter, pepper, and salt on each one,
and let them stand a minute before serving.</p>

slices of anchovy toast as already described,
and lay on each slice a poached egg.
Pour over all a cup of drawn butter in which
has been stirred a teaspoonful of chopped
parsley.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Boston Brown-Bread.</i>—Put a loaf of Boston
brown-bread into the inner vessel of a

Fried Pickerel. <span class="padl-1"> New Potatoes.</span><br />
Brown-Bread.<br />
Celery and Radish Salad.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Fried Pickerel.</i>—These fish are very delicious
when perfectly fresh. Each fish
should be rolled in flour and fried quickly in
hot dripping. Take them out of the pan as
soon as done.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Celery and Radish Salad.</i>—Cut the celery
into inch lengths, and toss it up with a
French dressing. Heap it in a bowl, and
arrange half-peeled radishes around the
mound. Pour over all a mayonnaise dressing
prepared according to the directions already
given. The combination of the cool

<p class="i1"><i>Jellied Tongue.</i>—One cup of the liquor in

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
stock or gravy of any meat except mutton,
half-box of gelatine, one gill cold water, one
cup boiling water, two tablespoonfuls vinegar,
one glass sherry, a cold boiled tongue,
sliced. Soak the gelatine in the cold water
for two hours. Pour over it the boiling
water, the stock or gravy, and the tongue
liquor, heated. Unless the gravy is highly
seasoned, it is a good plan to boil a bay leaf,
a sprig of parsley, a slice of onion, and a few
sweet herbs in a cup of water, and then to
strain this, and pour it over the gelatine instead
of using the plain boiling water. Flavor
the jelly with the vinegar, the sherry,
pepper, and salt, if the last is needed. Strain
all through a cloth. When the jelly begins
to harden, pour a little into a brick-shaped
mould or tin pan with straight sides, first
wetting the mould with cold water. Arrange
slices of tongue on this. Pour in more
jelly, then place another layer of tongue, and
continue thus until the supply of both is exhausted,
making jelly the last layer. Set the
mould on ice until the jelly is hard; turn it
out and slice on the table. This sounds like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
a fussy dish, but it is less trouble than appears
at first.</p>

of stale biscuit, leaving side walls and the
foundation of crust. Set these hollow shells
in the oven until dried. Boil asparagus
tender in salted water, cut off the tops,

<p class="i1"><i>Curried Oysters.</i>—Heat to boiling the
liquor from one quart of oysters; lay the
oysters in it, and let them simmer just long
enough to plump them. Take them out with
a skimmer, put them where they will keep
hot, and thicken the liquor by adding to it a
tablespoonful of butter rubbed smooth with
two of browned flour. Into this stir a teaspoonful
of curry-powder wet up in a little
cold water. Salt and pepper to taste, squeeze
in the juice of a lemon, return the oysters to
the sauce, and serve.</p>

of stalks of celery, and a bay-leaf. Strain it,
and return it to the fire with the white and
freshly broken shell of an egg. Let it boil
up, and strain it again, this time through a

<h2><a name="DINNER_AT_NIGHT" id="DINNER_AT_NIGHT"></a>DINNER AT NIGHT</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_t.jpg"
    alt="Letter T" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">TWENTY or thirty years ago the late
dinner was not nearly so popular as it is
now. The majority of the people dined in
the middle of the day, and not a few of them
considered a six-o'clock dinner as an effort
after fashion that was unworthy the imitation
of sensible men and women. Even in
large cities servants rebelled against an alteration
of the time-honored custom of serving
the principal meal of the day at or near
noon, while in small towns the late dinner
was so unusual that it was almost impossible
to persuade domestics to consent to it.</p>

<p class="i1">A marked change has taken place in the
fashion. The evening dinner has for years
been steadily gaining in popularity, and
promises to become even more common than
it is now. Thoughtful men and women
recognize the wisdom of eating lightly at
midday, when they are in the full tide of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
business, and reserving the heartiest repast
for an hour when it can be discussed leisurely
and digested peacefully. Mistresses have
learned that there is a gain in keeping the
morning free for house-work, instead of devoting
most of it to the preparation of the
dinner. The light lunch eaten in most homes
demands much less time in cooking and eating
than does a dinner, and leaves those who
have partaken of it more fit for work than
they would be were their stomachs burdened
with the task of digesting soup, meat, vegetables,
and dessert.</p>

<p class="i1">The late dinner is a more dignified meal
than can possibly be made of a similar repast
eaten at noon. The festal appearance imparted
by the gleam of candles, lamps, or gas
upon silver, china, and glass cannot be acquired
by daylight. The pleasant reunion
around the board of the members of the
family, whose positions and interests have
been divergent since morning, the happy
consciousness that the work of the day is
done, the knowledge that there is no toil
waiting at the door of the dining-room, all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
bear their share in rendering the meal cheerful
and care-free. More ceremony can and
should be preserved at the evening dinner
than is feasible at noon. The orderly sequence
of courses and careful serving
have a part in adding to the dignity of the
meal.</p>

<p class="i1">These suggestions should not frighten the
housekeeper who contemplates introducing
the late dinner in her household. Very little
extra work is involved in bestowing the
touch of state referred to, and, after all, it
consists chiefly in a slight additional care in
waiting and serving, and to these the mistress
can readily accustom the maid.</p>

<p class="i1">The dinner-table should be spread with a
plain white cloth, under which the sub-cover
of felt or canton flannel must never be lacking.
Any one who has observed the thin
and sleazy appearance even handsome damask
presents without this felt under it, and
has noticed the noise the dishes and silver
make when moved about where there is
but the one thickness between them and
the board, will not voluntarily be long without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
so simple and inexpensive an addition to
the elegance of her table.</p>

<p class="i1">It is sometimes a rather costly luxury to
keep a vase of fresh flowers always ready for
the table. In summer it is comparatively
easy, even in the city, to get a few blossoms
every day or two; but in winter, with flowers
at exorbitant prices, a single spray, renewed
twice a week, is an extravagance which the
housewife does not always feel she can afford
herself. Cheaper and quite as pretty in
effect is it to have a pot of primroses, or of
cyclamen, or of some other hardy house
plant that will bloom for two or three weeks,
and of which the first cost is but small.</p>

<p class="i1">In setting the table, the knife and the napkin,
with a piece of bread folded in the latter,
should lie at the right of the plate, the fork
at the left, the spoon at right angles to both
of these; between the plate and the middle
of the table, the glass, butter-plate, and salt-cellar
near the point of the knife, within easy
reach of the right hand. An extra knife or
fork may be added for each course, where
either may be needed. A plate must stand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
at each place, although it is usually removed
to make room for a hot one after the family
are seated and the dinner brought on.</p>

<p class="i1">The space in front of the hostess is left
free for the soup-tureen, and before the host
is spread the carving-cloth. The carving
knife and fork are laid upon this. At the
corner of the table stand the large salts, if
these are used instead of the individual cellars,
and the pepper-cruets. Near them are
the tablespoons. The water-pitcher, or
carafe, the ice bowl, and any relishes in the
shape of jellies, pickles, etc., are all else that
is put on the table at the beginning of the
meal, except the soup tureen and plates.</p>

<p class="i1">When the latter have been removed, the
principal meat dish is set in front of the
carver, and a hot plate is laid for each guest.
At family dinners the carver generally does
the helping, although sometimes after the
meat is cut it is passed, and each person allowed
to help himself.</p>

<p class="i1">The vegetables are next passed by the
waitress, and offered at the left of each
person, and after them the jelly or pickles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
are served. If, before the meat course,
a fish dish or an <i>entrée</i> is offered, it is
passed usually in the same fashion. Next
comes the salad, which is always passed,
after each guest has been supplied with a
clean plate. This course removed, all the
soiled dishes and the small silver are removed,
the table is crumbed, and the dessert
is brought in. If fruit succeeds this, a fresh
plate and a finger-bowl are given to each one.
With the fruit comes the coffee.</p>

<p class="i1">Of course there are many families in which
the daily <i>menu</i> is simpler than that outlined
above. In large families each added course
means a perceptible increase of cost, and
although the judicious manager who has a
fixed allowance for household expenses may
so dovetail the retrenchment of one day that
it will balance the undue outlay of another,
yet in most instances she will feel that if she
can feed her household well and satisfy them,
without providing them with five or six
courses at an ordinary dinner, more than this
would savor of extravagance. In some
homes soup each day is considered an expensive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
luxury. So it is when fresh meat
must be purchased to make it, or even when
fresh or canned vegetables have to be bought
for it; but when there are bones or trimmings
from raw or cooked meats, or vegetables
left over—a half-can of tomatoes, a cupful
or two of mashed potato, a saucer of
pease, or other similar remnants—or when
fish and eggs are plentiful, the soup need be
but a small item in the expense, and is really
economical, as, by blunting the edge of the
appetite, it renders the attack upon the next
course less vigorous. There is a large variety
of bean, pea, lentil, and cream soups
that are cheap, palatable, and nourishing.</p>

<p class="i1">Salad is not a frequent dish in many homes,
but in warm weather it may well be substituted
sometimes for soup and cost little
more. Still that may be a good dinner at
which neither soup nor salad is seen. The
final cup of tea or coffee adds a graceful finish
to a simple dessert, and is generally enjoyed
by the adult members of the family.</p>

<p class="i1">A word concerning the dinner toilette may
not be amiss. In England, donning full
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
dress for a late dinner is a matter of course.
Not so in America. Our independent citizen
usually thinks he honors the home meal
quite enough if he washes the dust of the day
from his hands and face, and brushes his hair
and his coat. Yet there are few homes in
which the mistress does not change her gown
for dinner, or at least brighten or freshen her
attire so as to make it differ decidedly from
that in which she appeared at breakfast.
The question involuntarily suggests itself
why it is easier for a tired woman to dress
than it is for a tired man, and one wonders
if the husband would not find in a change of
toilette the refreshment his wife experiences
from a similar operation. Even without putting
on full dress, a man should, at least by
exchanging his office for a house coat, and
assuming fresh collar, cuffs, and cravat, do
his share in giving to the dinner-table the
look of a pleasant social gathering, instead of
a mere stopping-place for food.</p>

<h2><a name="DINNER_AT_NOON" id="DINNER_AT_NOON"></a>DINNER AT NOON</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_i.jpg"
    alt="Letter I" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IN some homes it seems out of the question
to have a late dinner. There may be several
reasons for this. Possibly the mistress
of the house does all her own work, and finds
it easier to dispose of the bulk of her cooking
in the morning than later, since she thus
leaves free the afternoon hours for leisure or
social duties. Or she may, if she keeps servants,
live in a neighborhood where late dinners
are so far the exception that she finds it
impossible to induce her cook to accede to
her desire to change the hour of dinner. Or,
still again, it may seem expedient to dine at
noon, because that hour better suits her husband
and children. In any one of these
cases, instead of repining over the inevitable,
she should set herself to work to make the
best of circumstances, and do all in her power
to impart every possible charm to the midday
meal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">In some parts of the South a one-o'clock
dinner is almost unheard of, while the—to
Northerners—singular hour of two, or half
after two, or three, is chosen. This has the
advantage of giving the children plenty of
leisure for eating, as their schools have closed
by this hour; but the same necessity for
haste is laid upon the head of the house that
must always prevail when a busy man is
obliged to take the time for dinner out of
the most active part of the day. Whenever,
for any reason, the meal must be only an interlude
in work, instead of coming at the
close of the day's labors, it should be made
a comparatively simple repast.</p>

<p class="i1">There is no doubt that the average American
eats too rapidly. No one who has witnessed
the feats of deglutition performed by
commercial travellers at a railway station
will cavil at this assertion. It is safe to attribute
the national disease of dyspepsia to
this cause fully as much as to the indigestible
viands of which the ordinary citizen
makes his chief diet. And this haste is not
confined to the hotel dining-room or the railway
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
eating-house. In private households as
astonishing and disgusting exhibitions of
rapid gorging may be seen as are ever witnessed
in public restaurants.</p>

<p class="i1">No one who had once beheld the spectacle
could ever forget the fashion in which meals
were conducted in a certain home where
wealth and every evidence of outward refinement
gave promise of better things. The
father, a man of business from his sixteenth
year, plainly considered eating the duty to
be accomplished at the table, and quite ignored
such minor considerations as the interchange
of thought or observation, or any of
the social features usually connected with the
operation of dining. If he could not quite
equal Napoleon the First, who was said to
have often devoured his entire dinner in six
minutes, he did not fall far behind the great
warrior. Soup, meat, vegetables, dessert,
were swallowed in rapid succession and in
almost utter silence. The slight delay inseparable
from a change of courses was endured
impatiently. Almost before the last mouthful
was down, the eager man would push
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
back his chair, spring to his feet, and, with a
muttered word of farewell, make a rush for
the street. In an instant the slam of the
front door would announce that he was on
his way back to his office.</p>

<p class="i1">His children were not backward in imitating
him, and all the pleadings of their refined,
care-worn mother were powerless to
check the influence of the father's example.
With such a rush at meal-times, elegant or
even tolerably decent table manners were impossible,
and the visitor in the home found
eating a difficult business when accompanied
by the sight of the haste and habits that
often could only be described as revolting.</p>

<p class="i1">If the midday meal must be hurried, let it
also be simple. There is no rhyme or reason
in attempting to dispose of a three or four
course dinner in thirty or forty minutes. If
only half an hour can be allowed for the repast,
let this consist of two courses only, either a
soup and a meat course, a meat course and a
salad, or a meat course and a dessert. These
should be served promptly, but in an orderly
fashion, and both the conduct of the dinner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
and the gastric powers will be benefited by
such simplicity.</p>

<p class="i1">Upon this point the house mother must insist.
Even if her husband will not conform
to her wishes in this regard, she should require
from servants and children a certain
amount of propriety in serving the meal and
decorum in its discussion. After seeing that
the dinner is punctually served, and that the
courses follow one another promptly, she
should herself set the example of deliberate
eating, and should strive, by the introduction
of interesting subjects, to encourage the pleasant
chat that is a potent aid to digestion.
It will cost an effort to do this when she is
weary and harassed by household worries,
but she will enjoy her own meal more if her
mind is, by any agreeable means, distracted
for a little while from her cares.</p>

<p class="i1">For the midday dinner the table should
be laid as it is at night, and the waiting
should be performed in the same fashion.
The vegetables should, if possible, be served
from the side, although in a family where
no waitress is employed they may be set
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
upon the table. The custom of having four
or five vegetables at dinner appears rather
absurd. Where there are only two courses,
several kinds may be desired, but as a rule
two vegetables, or at the most three, are
quite enough. Only a few of these should
ever be served in saucers. Even at the
tables of people who ought to know better
it is nothing unusual to see two or three
or more small sauce-plates given to each
person. One will contain pease, another tomatoes,
another stewed corn, another pickles
or jelly. While there may be some sense in
having separate little dishes for holding such
semi-fluid compounds as stewed tomatoes,
stewed corn, or cranberry sauce, there is no
cause for using them for pease, string-beans,
spinach, cauliflower, and the like. The appearance
of such an array suggests a hotel
table, and detracts from the home-look which
should always be studied by the housekeeper.</p>

<p class="i1">Of course there is no possibility of dressy
toilettes at midday, but cleanliness and neatness
at least may be attained, and it should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
be one of the unwritten laws of the home
that no one may come to the table looking
untidy, or in <i>négligé</i> of curl-papers and collarless
wrappers for the women and shirt
sleeves for the men.</p>

<p class="i1">Possibly it may seem strange to many
people to learn that there are classes among
whom it is considered no breach of etiquette
for a man to come to the table not only coatless,
but even without his collar, cravat, or
vest; this, too, not among farmers alone,
but in cities and in ranks of life much above
those of the ordinary mechanic or common
day laborer. Often in the same families the
wives and daughters will appear well-bred,
and will dress neatly and tastefully themselves,
even while they seem to perceive nothing
shocking in the dishabille of the men of
the house. Perhaps, since those most interested
do not complain, no one else has a right
to criticise; and yet it does seem as though
the regard for appearances and for the small
sweet courtesies of life had some claims.</p>

<p class="i1">In most cases where one notes such carelessness,
it will be found that the trouble
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
began very far back, when the boys who are
now men were allowed a similar license in
their parents' homes. For the sake of the
families of the future, if for no other reason,
the mothers of the rising generation should
exact appropriate apparel at meals as well
as correct behavior and careful table manners
from their growing boys and girls, even
if the children's fathers refuse to conform to
what they deem over-niceness in dress and
demeanor.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_SUNDAY_DINNER" id="THE_SUNDAY_DINNER"></a>THE SUNDAY DINNER</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_t.jpg"
    alt="Letter T" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE "big dinner" of the week is, in most
homes, eaten on Sunday. Then the men
of the family are at home for the day, the
children have no claims of school or play to
hurry them through their meals, and there
is a general impression of delightful leisure
which seems favorable to the eating and digestion
of an excellent and hearty dinner.
This repast is usually served at midday, in
order that the servants may have the afternoon
and evening to themselves; and it is
not uncommon for the mistress of the house
to prepare the Sunday-evening tea herself.</p>

<p class="i1">The old-fashioned idea of always having a
cold dinner on the Sabbath is almost obsolete.
Some people who have been brought up in
the habit clung for a long while to the compromise
of serving a piece of cold meat at
the Sunday dinner, although the vegetables
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
were hot; but even that is changed now, and
there are few homes where as large an array
of smoking viands is not spread upon</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse">"The day that comes between</div>
    <div class="verse">The Saturday and Monday"</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="i1">as is ever offered on any non-religious holiday.</p>

<p class="i1">The reasons given at the beginning of this
chapter are quite sufficient to account for this
almost universal practice. The good housekeeper
enjoys seeing her culinary handiwork
appreciated, and she generally reserves any
especially tempting <i>bonnes bouches</i> for Sunday,
when she knows that those for whom
she delights to cater will have the time and
inclination to give her cookery its meed of
attention. Without cavilling at this, one
must at the same time deprecate the amount
of additional work that the Sunday dinner
often involves upon what should be, both
physically and spiritually, a day of rest as
well as of refreshment. A little thought
will often enable the housekeeper to so minify
the amount of work to be done on Sunday
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
that the domestic labors will be perceptibly
lightened, and the dinner in no wise injured.
So much of the preparation for the meal can
be made the day before that the business of
finally getting it ready for the table will seem
comparatively light.</p>

<p class="i1">In one family of strong Sabbatarian principles
the omission of soup from the Sunday
bill of fare was evidently considered a means
of grace. The tureen and ladle always enjoyed
a rest upon the first day of the week,
but by some curious process of ratiocination
no harm was thought of having at dinner a
course of salad which cost as much time to
prepare, and demanded the use and washing
of as many dishes as would have sufficed to
serve the tabooed soup. Yet the hostess
would always say, with an air of conscious
virtue, "Oh, we never have <i>soup</i> on Sundays,"
as though the non-appearance of that
dish upon the first day of the week was proof
positive of a high order of piety.</p>

<p class="i1">In spite of this, the soup course may be
made a very trifling affair. To say nothing
of two or three excellent brands of canned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
soups, which, with a little "doctoring" in the
way of seasoning, may be rendered quite
equal to those freshly made, there are many
soups which can be brought on Saturday
into a state of such complete readiness that
all that is necessary on Sunday is to heat
them for the table. Of these are chicken,
mutton, and veal broths, <i>consommé</i>, Julienne,
ox-tail, mock-turtle, black or white bean and
pea soup—indeed, nearly every soup with a
meat stock. Cream soups, like tomato, celery,
potato, cauliflower, green pea, and corn soups,
are better prepared just before using, and
these may be served on week-days and yet
leave a large variety of <i>potages</i> from which
to make a choice for the Sunday dinner.</p>

<p class="i1">Leaving the soup, something should be
said concerning the introduction of <i>entrées</i>,
etc. They are not necessary at a repast so
essentially domestic as the first-day feast.
Even if they are prepared the day before,
their insertion in the bill of fare compels the
use and washing of another set of plates.
The man-servant and maid-servant within
our gates merit a little consideration upon a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
day which should bring to them too a modicum
of rest. Still, if an <i>entrée</i> is occasionally
desired, there are those which may be made
on Saturday, and will need only warming to
be fit for the table, such as <i>pâtés</i> of various
kinds. For these both pastry shells and filling
may be prepared the day before, so that
simply heating them and putting them together
will comprise the work involved in
getting them ready for the table.</p>

<p class="i1">When the meat course is reached it becomes
less easy to shirk Sunday labor. The
roast may be bound and skewered, the turkey
or chickens trussed for roasting, the bread
crumbed for the stuffing, on Saturday, but
the stuffing must not go in until the last moment,
nor must the meats, to be at their best,
be put into the oven until just in time to permit
their being done in season for dinner.
With vegetables, too, much of the excellence
depends upon brisk cooking. Few of them
are, like spinach, benefited by each time of
warming over. Since this heavy work cannot
be avoided, all the housekeeper can do is
to make the rest of the meal as easy as possible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
for herself and her servants. At the
best, there will be enough to do.</p>

<p class="i1">If a salad is served, the mayonnaise dressing,
if this is used, is no whit injured by
keeping on the ice even for two or three
days. The fish, flesh, or fowl, when such
enter into the composition of the salad, may
be minced the day before, and kept in a cold
place until needed. Or if, as is better at dinner,
a simple salad of lettuce, celery, or something
of the kind is used, upon which the
hostess bestows an ordinary French dressing
after it is brought to the table, the washing
and picking over of the salad are a trifling
matter.</p>

<p class="i1">As to desserts, it is a peculiar taste which
refuses to be satisfied with some one of the
many that can be made in part or entirely
the day before.</p>

<p class="i1">The number of cold desserts is legion, and
ranges all the way from ices and frozen
creams through charlottes, jellies, and the
like, to the simple blanc-manges and custards,
to say nothing of preserved or brandied fruit.
Pies of countless kinds there are which can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
readily be heated, if a hot dessert is wished,
and there are delicious cakes which are almost
a dessert in themselves. Besides all
these, in this favored period, there is scarcely
a day in the year when an attractive dish of
fresh fruit is beyond the reach of people of
moderate means.</p>

<p class="i1">While anything approaching a desecration
of the Sabbath is to be avoided, there should
yet be a cheerfulness, a pleasant freedom of
speech at the Sunday dinner-table that ought
to render it the happiest meal of the week.
It is not the season for ceremonious entertaining—a
large Sunday dinner-party is
not in America in the best form, even in so-called
worldly society—but it is the time for
making a place within the circle of the home
for solitary men or women far from their own
people, who have only boarding-places or
restaurants at which to eat their Sunday dinner.
To them even a simple meal, eaten in a private
house and among friends, is a choice treat,
and inviting them is a deed which may fitly
be classed among the works of mercy which
even the Westminster Catechism permits.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_SMALL_DINNER-PARTY" id="THE_SMALL_DINNER-PARTY"></a>
  THE SMALL DINNER-PARTY</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_t.jpg"
    alt="Letter T" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THERE has been so much written about
the giving of dinner-parties that the
manager of a small household may well
shrink in dismay from the labor that obedience
to such rules would lay upon her.
When she reads descriptions of tables spread
with the most costly glass, silver, and china,
of courses consisting of delicacies prepared
from intricate directions, and served by three
or four trained servants—her heart sinks with
dismay, and she gives up then and there the
attempt to entertain her friends at dinner.</p>

<p class="i1">Such instructions may be of value to those
<i>nouveaux riches</i> who are at a loss how to
conduct a feast where expense is no object.
Even for them it seems as though it would
be easier to consign a big dinner to the charge
of a professional caterer than to drill their
own servants into fitness for preparing and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
serving such a repast as some of these manuals
describe. But there are many women
who wish to entertain gracefully, and yet
who have neither the means nor the inclination
to attempt doing so on a large or costly
scale. Possessing plenty of pretty napery,
silver, and china, having tolerably good cooks
and well-trained waitresses, they feel themselves
fairly equipped for giving small dinners,
especially when they may order some
of the most difficult dainties from outside.
They need not be appalled by the list of
what are to the majority of them unattainable
adjuncts, that are declared by writers
on the complete art of dining to be indispensable
to a correct dinner. Those who are
fitted by circumstances to follow these are
few indeed compared with the army of the
moderately well-to-do who find such elegance
quite beyond their modest means. So let
these pluck up heart of grace, and, instead
of obeying the quite natural impulse which
ensues upon the perusal of the aforesaid discouraging
guide-books to entertaining and
renouncing their plans of hospitality, resolve
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
rather to use their own common-sense and
good judgment, and give dinners in consonance
with these.</p>

<p class="i1">Of course there are certain rules for setting
the table, directing the proper sequence of
courses, and for the waiting, whose observance
marks familiarity with the etiquette of
dining, and whose absence denotes ignorance;
but these are so simple, so universal, and so
readily learned that once known it is easier
to follow them than to devise new ways.
Among the many advantages of practising
every day the proper methods of serving and
waiting is especially this, that when an emergency
of this sort arises, there need be only
an extension of daily customs, not a total departure
from ordinary habits.</p>

<p class="i1">The etiquette of a small dinner is essentially
the same as that of a large one. Any woman
who is sure of her <i>cuisine</i>, and who has
a waitress accustomed to her work, can give
a pretty little dinner, and there is no pleasanter
way of entertaining a few friends whom
one especially wishes to honor. For a party
of this sort, six is a good number. When
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
one goes beyond that, the necessity for a
more ceremonious etiquette, a more imposing
bill of fare, arises, and this the woman who
gives only little dinners wishes to shun.</p>

<p class="i1">In setting the table, care must be taken to
avoid the one extreme of over-crowding, and
the other of placing the guests so far apart
that <i>tête-à-tête</i> conversations are difficult. In
as small a company as this the talk is apt to
be general, but occasionally there is an opportunity
for a duet if the seats are near
enough together to allow two of their occupants
to carry on a low-voiced chat without
distracting the attention of the other guests
from their own topics of discussion.</p>

<p class="i1">In the arrangement of dishes, knives, forks,
etc., about the same rules are followed that
apply for luncheon-parties. A fork and a
knife for each course—the forks laid at the
left of the plate, the knives at the right, the
soup spoon across the top of the plate—the
usual array of salt-cellar, butter-plate (the
latter is often omitted at dinner), the glasses
for wine and for water, the folded napkin
holding a dinner roll, the card, the <i>menu</i>, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
individual flowers—all are much the same as
at a luncheon. The table-cloth should be of
the heaviest and handsomest damask, the
centre-piece, the floral decorations, the candelabra,
with their candles and silk shades,
the dishes, containing <i>hors-d'œuvres</i>, bonbons,
<i>glacé</i> fruits, etc., differ little from the similar
array on the table at a formal luncheon. The
same general plan is to be followed in serving
the courses. The dinner usually begins
with oysters or clams. Next comes a soup—<i>consommé</i>,
or a cream soup of some really
choice variety. A clear soup is to be preferred
as being light and easily digested, and
since one does not wish to begin the meal by
overloading the stomach, it is better on that
account than a cream soup or a <i>purée</i>.</p>

<p class="i1">Fish comes next, and this should be, as
is everything else served at a dinner, either
choice on account of its rarity, or because of
the excellent fashion in which it is cooked.
A piece of salmon or of baked halibut with
a <i>sauce hollandaise</i> is good, or, in their season,
salmon trout or any other game fish. Potatoes
in some form are served with this course.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
This is succeeded by an <i>entrée</i>, and that in
turn by the principal meat course of the
dinner, usually <i>filet de bœuf</i>, accompanied
by one or two fine vegetables. Next comes
Roman punch, then game or poultry, followed
or accompanied by salad, and after that
is the dessert—pastry, ices, creams, fruits,
coffee, etc. As may be seen by comparing
this outline with the directions given for a
luncheon, the two are very much alike. The
chief difference is in the kinds of food. Those
served at a dinner are generally of a more
solid character than those prepared for a
luncheon. The latter consists chiefly of <i>petits
plats</i>.</p>

<p class="i1">A small dinner should not last much more
than an hour and a half. It is readily disposed
of in that length of time if the cook
has the courses ready promptly, and if the
waitress understands her business. All the
carving should be done off the table. The
plates should be put in front of the guests
from the right side, and removed from the
left. Of course, whatever dish is passed must
be offered from the left side. To prevent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
mistakes the hostess should write out a full
list of all the courses, what dishes each comprises,
and from what china they are to be
served, noting, too, when there is a change
of silver. A copy of this schedule should be
in the hands of the cook, while the butler or
waitress should have a duplicate pinned up
in a convenient place in the butler's pantry,
to serve as a reference in case the memory
of one of them should play false.</p>

<p class="i1">While caterers can be found who will supply
almost any dish which may be suggested,
a graceful touch of individuality is imparted
to a dinner if certain <i>plats</i> are prepared at
home. Only, they must be well done, or they
were better omitted altogether. The ices,
biscuit, and Charlottes usually come from
outside, but the <i>entrées</i> and salads, as well as
soup, and the fish, meat, and game, may be
prepared in the house, and be none the worse
on that account.</p>

<p class="i1">Coffee is sometimes served in the dining-room,
but quite as often passed in the parlor.
It is never in good taste to have a large assortment
of wines at a small dinner. Claret
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
and champagne are quite enough, or even
claret alone is sufficient.</p>

<p class="i1">When the hostess is ordering her dinner,
she should bear in mind who her guests are
to be, and arrange her bill of fare in accordance
with her bill of company. The advisability
of this is illustrated in the anecdote
told of an English restaurateur who, on being
ordered to prepare a dinner for twelve
clergymen, begged respectfully to know if
they were High-Church or Broad-Church,
"for hif 'Igh-Church, they wants more
wine; hif Broad-Church, more wittles."</p>

<p class="i1">It is not worth while to prepare highly
spiced <i>entremets</i> and dishes of mushrooms
and terrapin for guests who would be better
suited with plainer viands; while, on the
other hand, a very simple dinner is not the
thing to set before a company of epicures.</p>

<h2><a name="A_LARGE_DINNER" id="A_LARGE_DINNER"></a>A LARGE DINNER</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_t.jpg"
    alt="Letter t" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THUS far the descriptions of breakfasts,
luncheons, and dinners have been given
from the standpoint of the housekeeper.
The outline of this, a more ceremonious meal
than any before described, will be from the
point of view of the guest, who regards everything
as a mere spectator, and not with
the eyes of the hostess, who has studied
every step of the repast from its inception
to its completion.</p>

<p class="i1">Two weeks before the dinner the guest receives
his invitation, which may have been
sent either by private hand or by post. The
latter method in these days of "magnificent
distances" is rapidly growing in favor. The
invitation card, which is about three and a
half inches wide by four and a half long, is
engraved in a dashing script as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>


<p class="ac"><span style="font-size:90%;">
<i>Mr. and Mrs. Pelham Blank<br />
request the pleasure of<br />
Mr. —— ——'s company<br />
at dinner on<br />
—— —— ——<br />
at half-past seven o'clock,<br />
—— Gramercy Square.</i></span></p>

<p class="i1">The name of the guest and the date of the
dinner are written in the blank spaces on the
card. To this invitation he sends an immediate
reply.</p>

<p class="i1">The guest reaches the house of his entertainers
on the appointed evening at a few
minutes before the dinner hour. In the coat-room
he finds a man-servant in attendance,
ready to assist in any trifling matters of the
toilet, who hands each gentleman, on a silver
tray, a tiny envelope, enclosing a card bearing
the name of the lady he is to take in to
dinner. Descending to the drawing-room,
the name of the guest is announced at the
door by a servant, who draws aside the portière
to allow him to enter. His first address
is, of course, to Mr. and Mrs. Blank, who
stand near the door receiving. The young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
man, Fidus by name, congratulates himself
inwardly that he at least is on time, and, seeing
at a glance how few of his fellow <i>convives</i>
have arrived, marvels anew, as he has
done often before, that well-bred people will
be so careless of the laws that regulate good
society as to arrive at a house ten, fifteen,
and even twenty minutes after the hour fixed
for dinner.</p>

<p class="i1">As Fidus has never met the young lady
whose name is written on the card presented
to him in the dressing-room, he promptly requests
an introduction of his hostess, and
chats with his fate for this evening until—all
of the fourteen invited guests having arrived—a
servant draws back the portières and announces
by a bow that dinner is served. Mr.
Blank offers his arm to the guest for whom
the dinner is especially given—a charming
Englishwoman—and the rest of the party
follow them to the dining-room. There is
no suggestion of precedence, except as the
younger guests naturally give way to the
elders of the company. Mrs. Blank and her
attendant cavalier come last.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">The dining-room, a fine large apartment, is
lighted only by candles; but there are plenty
of these in sconces, in candelabra, in candle-sticks
of odd and pretty designs. Flowers
are all about wherever their use, either singly
or massed, can produce a good effect.</p>

<p class="i1">The places at table are marked by plain
white cards, each with the name of a guest
painted on it in gold. The table decorations
are quiet in effect, but in excellent taste.
The cloth, of pure white plain damask, is
covered through the centre with a scarf of
elaborate drawn-work. In place of the towering
épergnes once so fashionable, the floral
ornaments, candelabra, etc., are all low.
Pink roses, white lilacs, and maidenhair ferns
are the flowers used; and these are not arranged
in set form, but are simply massed
in cut-glass bowls, three in number, placed
here and there through the centre of the table.
The candelabra are also of cut glass,
which is used wherever it is possible, in preference
to silver. A corsage bouquet of the
flowers mentioned above, tied with a wide
pink ribbon, awaits each lady at her place,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
while a <i>boutonnière</i> lies beside the name card
of each man. The candles are shaded with
alternate pink and white shades, and the silver
and china are of the daintiest and prettiest.</p>

<p class="i1">At each place are two large knives and a
smaller one—one of these being supposed to
be for fish, although it is decidedly <i>contre
les règles</i> to use a knife for fish—a small
fork for fish, three large forks, a spoon for
soup, and a small oyster fork. The knives
are at the right, the forks at the left of the
plate, and on the left is also the folded napkin
containing the bread. The glasses for
water and wine are on the right. There are
generally four of the latter, for claret, sauterne,
champagne, and sherry.</p>

<p class="i1">A plate holding raw oysters and a piece of
lemon is at each place when the guests enter.
When these have been eaten, soup is served,
a <i>consommé</i>; and this is not brought to the
table in the tureen, but is served from the
side. Next comes the fish—a piece of salmon,
with lobster sauce, it happens to be on this
particular occasion—and it is followed by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
<i>entrées</i>. To save time, three of these are
served at once; but Fidus declines one, deeming
it unwise to overload his plate and his
stomach at so early a stage in the proceedings.</p>

<p class="i1">After the <i>entrées</i> comes the roast, with one
vegetable; and the sorbet or Roman punch
succeeds this, and precedes the game. Salad,
cheese, and bread-and-butter compose the
next course, and, the table being cleared for
dessert, ices make their appearance. After
these are disposed of come the fruit, bonbons,
etc.</p>

<p class="i1">Wine has, of course, flowed freely during
the repast, but the drinking has been very
moderate, after all, and each guest has felt
at liberty to refuse any of the wines offered.
Sherry has been served with the soup, sauterne
with the fish, and claret with the roast,
while after the first course or two champagne
has had all seasons for its own. At some
dinners a larger number of wines are served,
but this, so far from being essential, is not
considered strictly good form. Nor have
there been favors given, as one would suppose,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
from perusing books of etiquette, that this is
a common custom at ceremonious dinners.
Such a proceeding, while it might in one way
be agreeable to the guests, would entail a
heavy burden of expense upon the hosts, and
might, moreover, place the recipients of
these mementos under an obligation which
they would not thoroughly enjoy. If favors
are given, they should be pretty but inexpensive
trifles.</p>

<p class="i1">The dessert discussed, the ladies leave the
gentlemen to their own devices for a while,
and retire to the drawing-room. Coffee
might have been served before they quitted
the table, but in this case it is sent to the
ladies in the drawing-room, where they sip it
leisurely, while the men enjoy theirs with
their cigars in the <i>salle à manger</i>, and partake
of the tiny glasses of cordial that is
supposed to serve as an aid to digestion.
When they finally leave the table two hours
and a half have passed since they seated
themselves, and they are quite ready to stand
about the drawing-room chatting for a while
after their prolonged <i>séance</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">As no music or other entertainment beyond
the dinner has been arranged for the
guests, they remain only about an hour after
the meal is ended, and then make their
acknowledgments and adieux to the host
and hostess, and wend their respective ways
homeward.</p>

<h2><a name="FAMILY_DINNERS_FOR_SPRING" id="FAMILY_DINNERS_FOR_SPRING"></a>
  FAMILY DINNERS FOR SPRING</h2>

<p class="ac">1.<br />
Lentil Soup.<br />
Fricasseed Chicken.<br />
Rice Croquettes. <span class="padl-1"> Buttered Sweet Potatoes.</span><br />
Peach Brown Betty.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Lentil Soup.</i>—One pint lentils, two quarts
cold water, one onion, one tablespoonful
flour, two teaspoonfuls butter, pepper and
celery-salt to taste. Soak the lentils overnight
in cold water; drain them the next
morning, and put them over the fire with
the two quarts of water and the onion; simmer
for several hours until the lentils are
very soft. If the water boils away too fast,
replenish the amount from the tea-kettle.
When the lentils are done, rub them through
the colander and return them to the fire;
cook the butter and flour together in a small
saucepan until the mixture bubbles, and stir
into the soup. Season to taste, and pour on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
tiny squares of fried bread laid in your tureen,
and serve.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Buttered Sweet Potatoes.</i>—Boil good-sized
sweet potatoes, scrape them, and slice them
lengthwise; butter each piece, lay all in a
pan, and set them in the oven until the butter
is well melted into the potatoes.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Peach Brown Betty.</i>—Stew a pound of
evaporated peaches until tender and plump;
place a layer of these in the bottom of a
pudding dish, sprinkle them plentifully with
sugar, and strew them quite thickly with fine
bread-crumbs, scattering a little cinnamon
over this; then arrange another layer of
peaches, more sugar, crumbs, and spice, and
so continue until the dish is full. Just before
adding the last layer, which should be
of crumbs, pour in as much of the liquor in
which the peaches were stewed as the dish
will hold without "floating" the contents.
After the top stratum of crumbs is in place,
dot it with bits of butter; bake it covered
for half an hour in a moderate oven, uncover
and brown. Eat with hard sauce.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Hard Sauce.</i>—One tablespoonful butter,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
one cup powdered sugar, half-teaspoonful
flavoring. Cream the butter and sugar together
until very light, flavor, press into a
cup or small mould, turn out, and pass with
the pudding.</p>

<p class="ac">2.<br />
Boiled Mutton, Sauce Soubise.<br />
Mashed Turnips. <span class="padl-1"> Baked Hominy.</span><br />
Apple Charlotte.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Boiled Mutton, Sauce Soubise.</i>—In purchasing
your mutton, select a fine large leg,
and have it cut in two, in such a way that
the knuckle and the lower part of the leg
will make a good piece for boiling, leaving
the upper part for roasting.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Sauce Soubise.</i>—Four onions chopped, one
tablespoonful flour, one tablespoonful butter,
one cup of the liquor in which the mutton
was boiled; pepper and salt to taste. Stew
the onions until very tender; drain them, and
rub them through a colander; put the butter
and flour together in a little saucepan, cook
them until they bubble; add the mutton
liquor, which must have been cooled and
skimmed; stir all together until thick and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
smooth; add the pepper, salt, and the strained
onions; pass with the boiled mutton. If
properly made, this is a very appetizing sauce.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Baked Hominy.</i>—To two cupfuls of cold
boiled hominy add a tablespoonful of melted
butter, a tablespoonful of white sugar, one
egg beaten, a cupful of milk, and a little salt;
beat all together until light, and bake in a
buttered pudding dish. Serve as a vegetable.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Apple Charlotte.</i>—Two eggs, two cups
milk, half-cup sugar, two cups rather stiff
apple-sauce. Make a boiled custard of the
yolks of the eggs, the milk, and the sugar;
whip the whites of the eggs very light, and
beat them into the apple sauce, which should
have been well sweetened while hot. Heap
the sauce and whites in a dish, and pour the
custard over it. Set in the ice-box, or some
other cold place for half an hour before sending
to the table.</p>

<p class="ac">3.<br />
Mutton and Rice Broth.<br />
Roast Mutton.<br />
Creamed Parsnips. <span class="padl-1"> Mashed Potatoes.</span><br />

<p class="i1"><i>Mutton and Rice Broth.</i>—Strain and skim
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
the liquor in which the mutton was boiled;
put it over the fire with two tablespoonfuls
of raw rice, and let it cook about three quarters
of an hour, until the rice is soft; stir
into it a cup of boiling milk which has been
thickened with a tablespoonful of flour. After
this is added to the broth, let it boil up
once, and then serve.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Creamed Parsnips.</i>—Boil and peel parsnips;
cut them in slices, and, after spreading
each slice with butter, lay in a vegetable
dish, and pour over them a white sauce made
of a cup of boiling milk cooked until thick
with two teaspoonfuls of flour and one of
butter; pepper and salt to taste.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Sponge-Cake Trifle.</i>—Cut a stale sponge-cake
into slices, and pour over each piece
enough sherry to moisten it thoroughly.
Spread the cake with raspberry or strawberry
jam, and cover all with a pint of
whipped cream, slightly sweetened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

Creamed Spaghetti.<br />
Asparagus Salad.<br />
Crackers and Cheese.<br />
Coffee.<br />
Light Cakes.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Baked Tomatoes.</i>—Select fine large tomatoes,
and cut a small piece out of the stem
end of each. In this hole place a small lump
of butter, about half the size of a hickory-nut.
Bake the tomatoes slowly for half an
hour; take up, and keep hot while you thicken
the juice left in the pan with a teaspoonful
of flour wet up in a very little cold water.
Set the pan on top of the stove, and let its
contents boil up once. Season to taste with
pepper and salt, and pour this sauce over the
tomatoes.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Creamed Spaghetti.</i>—One half pound spaghetti
boiled tender in two quarts boiling
water, slightly salted; one tablespoonful
butter; two teaspoonfuls flour; one cup
milk; four tablespoonfuls grated cheese;
pepper and salt to taste. Cook the butter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
and flour together; add the seasoning and
the cheese. Drain the spaghetti, put it in a
deep dish, and pour the sauce over it.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Asparagus Salad.</i>—Boil a bunch of asparagus
until tender; drain it, and put it on the
ice. When perfectly cold, pour over it a
half-cupful mayonnaise dressing into which
has been stirred a teaspoonful of French
mustard. Canned asparagus may be used
when the fresh is out of season.</p>

<p class="ac">5.<br />
Cream Corn Soup.<br />
Stewed Pigeons.<br />
Baked Potatoes. <span class="padl-1"> Fried Bananas.</span><br />

<p class="i1"><i>Cream Corn Soup.</i>—One can corn, three
cups boiling water, two cups milk, one tablespoonful
butter, two tablespoonfuls flour,
one egg, pepper and salt to taste. Drain the
liquor from the corn, and chop the latter
fine; cook it in the boiling water for an
hour; rub it through the colander, and return
it to the fire. Have the milk hot in a
farina kettle. Thicken it with the flour and
butter; season, and pour a little at a time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
upon the beaten egg. Stir this in with the
hot corn <i>purée</i>, and serve at once.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Stewed Pigeons.</i>—Cut pigeons in half, place
a layer of salt pork cut in thin strips in the
bottom of a saucepan, and lay the pigeons on
this; sprinkle with a little chopped onion;
pour over them enough hot water to cover
them, put a closely fitting top on the pot,
and cook them slowly for two hours. Take
out the birds and the pork, and keep them
hot while you thicken the gravy left in the
pot with a little browned flour wet up in cold
water; boil up once, pour over the pigeons,
and serve.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Fried Bananas.</i>—Select firm bananas, peel
them, and slice them lengthwise; dip them in
egg, roll them in very fine cracker-crumbs,
and fry them in deep fat to a light brown.
Serve on a napkin laid in a deep dish.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Apricot Fritters.</i>—Stew evaporated apricots
until tender, adding, when half done,
sugar in the proportion of two tablespoonfuls
to every cupful of juice. When the
apricots are tender, take them out, leaving
the syrup to reduce by boiling until it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
quite thick. Dip each piece of apricot into
a frying batter made of a cup of flour, a tablespoonful
of melted butter, a small cup of
warm water, and the white of an egg beaten
light; drop these fritters into boiling deep
fat. When done, lay on a piece of brown
paper in a colander for a few minutes, transfer
to a hot dish, and pour the hot syrup
over and around them.</p>

Preserved Ginger.<br />
Fancy Cakes.</p>

<p class="ac">1.<br />
Green-Pea Soup.<br />
Roast Shoulder of Veal.<br />
Boiled Potatoes. <span class="padl-1"> Asparagus with Eggs.</span><br />
Cherry Dumplings.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Green-Pea Soup.</i>—One quart shelled pease
cooked until tender, one quart milk, two tablespoonfuls
butter, one teaspoonful sugar,
one tablespoonful flour, salt to taste. Press
the pease, after they have been boiled and
drained, through a colander; put them back
on the fire, and stir into them the milk, boiling
hot, thickened with the butter and flour
and seasoned with the sugar and salt. Boil
up once, and serve.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Asparagus with Eggs.</i>—One bunch asparagus,
two hard-boiled eggs, one cup white
sauce. Boil the asparagus until tender; cut
the stalks into inch lengths, rejecting the
hard woody portions; chop the hard-boiled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
eggs coarsely, and stir with the asparagus
into the white sauce, which must be boiling
hot. Serve at once.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Cherry Dumplings.</i>—Make a biscuit crust
of two cups of flour, a tablespoonful of butter
rubbed into it, a little salt, a teaspoonful
of baking-powder, and milk enough to make
a soft dough. Roll out into a sheet a quarter
of an inch thick, and cut into squares
about three inches across. Stone the cherries;
put a spoonful into the centre of each
square of paste; sprinkle with sugar, fold
the edges across, and pinch them together.
Lay them with the pinched edges downward
in a pan, and bake to a light brown. Eat
with a hard sauce made as directed in the
preceding chapter.</p>

<p class="ac">2.<br />
Fish Chowder.<br />
Broiled Lamb Chops. <span class="padl-1"> Raw Tomatoes.</span><br />
Young Onions Stewed.<br />
Strawberry Méringue.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Fish Chowder.</i>—Two pounds fresh fish,
two good-sized potatoes, one cup milk, a
quarter of a pound of salt pork, one onion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
minced, one tablespoonful chopped parsley,
enough boiling water to cover all the ingredients
after they are in the pot. Cut up the
fish, the pork, and the potatoes (which should
have been peeled and parboiled) into pieces
less than an inch square. Place in a pot or
saucepan first a layer of pork, then one of
fish strewn with onions and parsley, then
one of potatoes; repeat the layers in this
order until all the materials are used. Pour
in the water, cover closely, and let it cook
slowly a full hour. Split and butter half a
dozen Boston crackers; let them soak in the
cupful of milk over the fire for five minutes;
take them out, and lay them in the tureen,
and pour the chowder over them. Pass
lemon with it.</p>

<p class="i1">This chowder is even better the second
day than the first, although there is rarely
much left over.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Strawberry Méringue.</i>—Line a pie-dish
with puff paste, bake this carefully, and then
place in it a thick layer of hulled strawberries;
rather small ones are best for this purpose.
Sprinkle them with powdered sugar,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
and heap over them a méringue made of the
whites of four eggs whipped stiff with half
a cup of powdered sugar. Just before putting
it in stir lightly into it a cupful of the
berries. Set the pie-plate containing the méringue
in the oven long enough to brown
delicately, and eat when perfectly cold.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Asparagus Soup.</i>—Boil a bunch of asparagus
until it is very tender. When done, cut
off the green tips, and put them aside, and
rub the stalks in a colander, getting all of
them through that you can. Heat four cups
of milk in a double boiler, add the strained
asparagus to this, and thicken with a tablespoonful
of butter rubbed in one of flour.
Season to taste with salt and pepper, add the
asparagus tops (which should have been kept
hot), and serve.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Raspberry Pudding.</i>—Two cups raspberries
(red or black), three cups flour, three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
eggs, two cups milk, one tablespoonful butter,
two teaspoonfuls baking-powder, saltspoonful
salt. Beat the eggs very light, and
mix with the butter, melted, and the milk.
Stir into this the flour sifted with the salt
and baking-powder, taking care that the batter
does not lump. Dredge the berries with
flour, add them to the pudding, and boil this
in a plain pudding mould, set in a pot of
boiling water, for three hours. Take care
that the water does not come over the top of
the mould. Serve with hard sauce.</p>

one tablespoonful mint chopped very fine,
one tablespoonful white sugar, a very little
salt and pepper. Pour the vinegar upon the
sugar and mint, and let them stand in a cool
place a full hour before using. Add the salt

<p class="i1">For the benefit of those who are sometimes
unable to procure the fresh herb, it may be
stated that the dried mint sold in bottles is
an excellent substitute.</p>

grated cheese; one onion; two cups milk;
two cups veal, chicken, or other white stock;
one tablespoonful flour; one tablespoonful
butter; pepper and salt to taste. Heat the

and flour rubbed smooth together. Stir in
the cheese, pour a little of the soup on the
egg beaten light, add this to the soup in the
pot, season, and serve immediately. It is a
good plan to put a tiny pinch of soda into
the milk before adding the cheese.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Beef à la Mode.</i>—Select a good piece of
beef from the round, and "plug" it thickly
with beef suet or with strips of fat salt pork.
Make other incisions into which to crowd a
force-meat made of finely chopped salt pork
mixed with twice the bulk of bread-crumbs,
and seasoned with herbs, allspice, onion, and
vinegar. Fasten the meat securely in shape
with a stout band of cotton cloth, lay it in a
pot, pour over it three cups of boiling water,
cover closely, and cook slowly for three
hours, or until tender. Turn the meat once.
Thicken the gravy left in the pot with
browned flour, and pass with the meat.</p>

<p class="i1">This piece of meat will be as good cold as
it is hot, and makes a welcome <i>pièce de résistance</i>
upon which to rely for lunch or tea.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Fried Cucumbers.</i>—Peel the cucumbers;
slice them lengthwise, making about four
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
slices of a cucumber of ordinary size. Lay
them in salt and water for an hour, take out,
drain, and dry. Dip first in beaten egg, then
in cracker-crumbs, and fry as you would egg-plant.</p>

cauliflower into small clusters, chop all except
two bunches, and put all on the fire in
four cups of boiling water with a minced
onion and a couple of sprigs of parsley; cook
until tender. Remove the unchopped bunches,
and lay them aside, while you rub the
chopped and boiled portion through a colander;
return what comes through the sieve
to the stove. Have ready in a double boiler
a pint of scalding milk; thicken this with a
tablespoonful of butter rubbed smooth with
an equal quantity of flour, and then mix with
the strained cauliflower. Season to taste,

drop in the reserved clusters cut into small
bits, and serve the soup immediately.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Baked Tomatoes and Corn.</i>—Cut a slice
from the top of each of several large firm
tomatoes; scoop out about two thirds of the
pulp, taking care not to break the sides; fill
the cavities thus left with green corn, boiled,
cut from the cob, and chopped fine with a
little butter, pepper, and salt; arrange the
tomatoes thus stuffed in a baking-dish, put
a few bits of butter here and there between
them, and bake half an hour. If you have a
half-cupful of good gravy, pour this over
them instead of putting the butter between
them.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Fried Egg-Plant.</i>—Peel and cut the egg-plant
into slices less than half an inch thick
an hour before it is to be cooked; lay the
slices in salted iced water, with a plate over
them to keep them from floating. Just before
dinner wipe each slice dry, lay it in
beaten egg, and then roll it in salted and
peppered cracker-crumbs. Have ready lard
or really good dripping in a frying-pan, and
fry the slices brown.</p>

this has browned add the veal bones, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
celery, the parsley, and water. Let all simmer
gently for several hours. Set the soup
aside with the meat in it until cool; skim,
strain, and return to the pot, with the raw
rice and the seasoning. Let the soup cook
slowly until the rice is tender, and then serve.
Pass grated cheese with this soup.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Stewed Lamb à la Jardinière.</i>—Select a
good-sized breast of lamb, and lay it in a
saucepan; pour over it enough cold water to
nearly cover it, and put a closely fitting lid
on the pot. While it is simmering gently,
parboil half a cupful of string or Lima beans,
half a cupful of green pease (fresh or canned),
two small carrots cut into neat, thin slices,
and a few clusters of cauliflower. When the
lamb is nearly done, lay these vegetables on
it; put with them two tomatoes sliced, and
cook about fifteen minutes. In serving this
dish arrange the vegetables around the meat,
and pour over them the gravy, which should
be thickened with browned flour after the
meat and vegetables have been taken from it.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Sliced Peach Pie.</i>—Line a pie-plate with
a good paste, and cover it with peaches,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
sliced, but not peeled; sprinkle thickly with
sugar, and bake in a steady oven. There

<p class="drop-cap">THE cook-book of the olden time gave its
recipes with a generous disregard of
cost. Such items as a ham boiled in wine
were not unusual, and the quantities of costly
materials demanded were on a Gargantuan
scale. Even in the average French culinary
manuals economy can hardly be said to be
conspicuous, except by its absence, although
Gallic cooks have a world-wide reputation
for the wonderful results they can produce
by a small expenditure. Even in this day,
when economy is honored and studied, in
the recipes that appear in print as written
by women living in some parts of the South,
there is a call for what to Northern ideas
seems a reckless profusion of eggs, butter,
and cream. The lavishness of these demands
is often quite out of keeping with the common
opinion of the straitened circumstances
supposed to have prevailed of late years in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
that section of the country. The general
impression these recipes give was voiced by
a New England woman, who, after reading
a collection of recipes from the pen of a well-known
Southern writer, exclaimed, "Well, <i>I</i>
can't afford to cook like that; but I presume
she has always had plenty to do with."</p>

<p class="i1">In spite, however, of some instances of this
kind which indicate extravagance, the general
trend in culinary guide-books of the day
is towards economy. Tracts, pamphlets, octavos,
and quartos are published, giving directions
for preparing a dinner for five persons
at a cost of twenty-five cents, of fifty
cents, of seventy-five cents, of a dollar. The
Sunday and weekly newspapers have columns
devoted to the same theme, and the
countless household magazines with which
the reading public is almost snowed under
all spare a corner for the discussion of the
same momentous topic. It may be noted, <i>en
passant</i>, that this sudden interest in dietetics
is responsible for many of the literary aspirations
now current. Women who had never
thought of meddling with pen and ink except
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
in their private correspondence rush into
print for the purpose of describing a dinner
which will cost only twenty-seven and two-thirds
cents, and, encouraged by success in
one or two efforts of this kind, fondly imagine
themselves possessed of talents which
ought to bring them in a competency.</p>

<p class="i1">Far be it from the woman who has herself
known housekeeping cares and struggles,
who has mourned over small leaks and
sought diligently the best methods of "making
sixpence do the work of sevenpence half-penny,"
as an English writer puts it, to deride
any endeavors to teach housekeepers
how to best use slender means with happy
results. But a word of warning may not be
amiss concerning certain features of most of
the directions thus given. Here it is: If an
appetizing dish is to be made at small cost,
care in preparation <i>must</i> supplement cheap
materials.</p>

<p class="i1">There has been a great deal said and written
about the folly of always purchasing the
best cuts of meat. Hundreds of pages have
been printed demonstrating satisfactorily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>—to
their authors—that a piece of beef from
the round can be so cooked as to make it
equal to <i>filet de bœuf</i>; that lamb's or pig's
liver is of as good a flavor as calf's liver,
which costs twice as much; that old fowls
properly treated cannot be distinguished by
the taste from young broilers; and that a
variety of other delightful things can be accomplished
by the woman who chooses to
attempt them. All this is, no doubt, true in
part. The point that is seldom sufficiently
emphasized is that it requires to achieve
these wonders either a certain knack, which
is as much a talent in its way as is a gift for
music or drawing, or else a special training
in this particular kind of cookery. It is easy
enough for any one to be a good cook who
knows how to follow a recipe, possesses a little
deftness of hand, and is provided with the
best materials for her work. Nowadays the
cook-books seldom deal in the glittering generalities
that once made their pages full of
pitfalls for the unwary. Usually the directions
are explicit, the quantities and proportions
almost scientific in their accuracy, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
the successive steps in compounding and
cooking so clearly defined that the wayfaring
woman, although a fool, can hardly go
very far wrong; that is, <i>if</i>—and it is a very
big if, too—she does not have to use imperfect
ingredients to compass a perfect achievement.
Bricks may doubtless be made with
stubble instead of straw, but the children of
Israel found it a rather difficult process.</p>

<p class="i1">If, then, to change the figure, the iron be
dull, one must put to it the more strength.
The housekeeper who is compelled by circumstances
to practise rigid economy must
resolutely set herself to the study of cheap
cookery. She may know already how to
roast a "rib cut" of beef, how to broil a porterhouse
steak, how to broil and fry tender
chickens, but all this knowledge is of comparatively
little value to her just now. She
must learn instead how to braise, how to
treat a "pot roast"; she must study stews,
perfect herself in the manufacture of minces,
hashes, fricassees, croquettes, fritters; she
must know what vegetables and meats may
be put together in utilizing "left-overs";
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
she must acquire a thorough knowledge of
soups of all sorts, and of soups <i>maigre</i> in
particular; and she must work in this line
until she is able to set as appetizing if not as
elegant a table on her small means as her
richer neighbor across the way can on a
housekeeping allowance of a double amount.</p>

<p class="i1">Of course this involves a great deal of hard
work and of competent vigilance. Even if a
servant is kept, only in rare instances can she
be trusted to undertake this kind of cookery.
Simple cookery, like roasting and boiling, is
seldom successful unless one has the best
materials to work with. But usually the
woman who must economize is wealthier in
time than in anything else, and she must
make it take the place of money. Above
all, she must struggle against the temptation
to yield to weariness or discouragement, and
to satisfy herself with the custom into which
so many of her sisters drift, of cooking tough,
inferior pieces of meat in the easiest way, as
though they were "prime cuts," and thus endangering
the teeth, tempers, and digestions
of her family.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">A potent aid in making cheap cookery
savory is the judicious use of seasoning. In
some homes knowledge of these seems to be
confined to an acquaintance with pepper,
mustard, onion, and parsley. Little is known
of the variety of even simple herbs, like
thyme, sweet-marjoram, and summer-savory;
and still less of Worcestershire, Harvey's,
anchovy, and chilli sauces, of chutney, of
curry powder, of tarragon vinegar, of bay
leaves, of <i>maître d'hôtel</i> butter, of olives, of
tomato and walnut catsups, or of the careful
employment of spices in small quantities.
The magical improvement wrought by the
addition of a little lemon juice and a wine-glassful
of California sherry (at fifty cents a
quart bottle) is totally unknown.</p>

<p class="i1">Of course the first outlay for some of these
commodities may savor of extravagance.
But many of the articles are very cheap, and
even the more costly ones are used in such
small quantities that a supply of any one of
them will last a long time. Moreover, if a
woman's aim is to prepare dishes which
her family will eat and enjoy, she will find
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
that the purchase of condiments pays, and
the variety their occasional use gives will
make a change back to simple diet more
agreeable.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_CHILDRENS_TABLE" id="THE_CHILDRENS_TABLE"></a>THE CHILDREN'S TABLE</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_i.jpg"
    alt="Letter I" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IN comparatively few American homes
does the custom prevail of giving the
children their meals apart from their parents.
Domestic arrangements would be sadly complicated
were it common in the ordinary
household, as it is in England, to have a
separate breakfast served for the little ones
in their nursery while the seniors discuss their
more elaborate morning repast in their own
<i>salle à manger</i>.</p>

<p class="i1">Usually, and wisely, American children eat
at least two of their meals with their parents,
and thus have what benefit may be derived
from association with older people. It
is only when the father and mother fail to
guard against letting the little ones gradually
assume the reins of government that affairs
reach a point which makes one long to banish
the babies to the nursery, or even further,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
if by such means peace might be secured at
meal-times.</p>

<p class="i1">Nowhere does the spoiled child appear to
worse advantage, or make more of a nuisance
of himself, than at the table. His incessant
chatter, the constant interruption his appeals
for attention make in the conversation of
the older people present, his clamorous demands
for any article of food which happens
to strike his fancy, his loud protests when
his wishes are denied him, his slovenly (often
disgusting) habits of eating, make the family
meal-times a pandemonium and penance to
the hapless guest upon whom the youngster
has no claims of affection to render his vagaries
amusing or interesting.</p>

<p class="i1">So long as custom and necessity render it
advisable to have a child at the same table
with his parents, these should fix upon a
plan of action, and adhere to it. Desiring
to have their children looked upon as comforts
and not as spoil-sports, they should enforce
strict obedience, exact quiet at table,
and inculcate stringently the once-honored
maxim—of late years fallen sadly into disuse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
and disrepute—that little boys and girls
should be seen and not heard. Remembering
how much easier it is to check a habit at
the outset than to break it off after it is fully
formed, the father and mother should watch
their children's table manners, and repress at
once the carelessness and unpleasant tricks
that seem, possibly through original sin, to
come naturally to most little folk. The
correct handling of spoon, fork, and knife
should be taught as soon as they are permitted
to use these implements, and slovenliness
should be rebuked and held up as a disgrace.
Not least in importance is it that the father
and mother should, after due consideration,
establish an outline of diet for the youngsters,
and allow no divergence therefrom.</p>

<p class="i1">By "an outline of diet" is not meant an
unvarying rotation of viands as wearying
and de-appetizing to the child as it would be
to his elders, but a scheme of nourishment
by which hurtful articles of food will be
eliminated from the bill of fare, and only
wholesome ones admitted. A great deal of
careful thought is often necessary in the formulation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
of such <i>menus</i>, for children have
as many gastric idiosyncrasies as grown people,
and frequently these are only disclosed
little by little. In illustration of this may be
cited the case of a handsome, healthy boy
baby who, although a victim to colic during
the first months of his life, gave no other
evidences of eccentricity of digestion until
he was nearly three years old. At that time
the mother began to notice that his breath
was often sour, and that he complained occasionally
of pain in the stomach and bowels.
His dietary had always been so simple that
she was at first puzzled to understand what
could be the disturbing cause. After sundry
experiments and careful observation, she
finally ascertained that the discomfort and
bad breath followed any unusual eating of
sweets, although it might be only such simple
desserts as bread and syrup, bread and
jelly, plain cookies, or home-made sponge-cake,
or even an infrequent lump of sugar.
She put an embargo upon sweets, and
found an almost immediate improvement.
Further investigation demonstrated that an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
occasional indulgence—say once a day—produced
no evil consequences, but that more
frequent treats of this sort had painful
<i>sequelæ</i>. Her course thereafter was plain
and easily followed.</p>

<p class="i1">A child's breakfast should always begin
with some cereal, but this need not invariably
be oatmeal. Other preparations often
agree better with the children, and a variety
is preferable to the monotonous use of the
one kind of porridge. Gruels or porridges
of farina, corn-starch, rice-flour, corn-meal,
hominy, arrowroot, wheat-germ meal, or cerealine
are nearly all relished by the babies,
and should be accompanied by milk in any
amount, but <i>no sugar</i>. If the child has never
been accustomed to the latter, he will eat
quite as heartily without it.</p>

<p class="i1">If the porridge is properly prepared, the
little ones will usually make their chief
breakfast from it, with milk or milk-and-water
as a beverage. Tea, coffee, or chocolate
should be tabooed. The children are better
off without any of the three, although some
mild preparation of cocoa is probably the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
least harmful drink they can have other than
milk or cold—not iced—water.</p>

<p class="i1">As the little people grow older they may
have a second course of baked or stewed potato,
buttered, dry, or milk toast, a soft-boiled
or poached egg, bread and butter, bread and
jam, or a little fruit, either fresh or stewed.
When they have once become accustomed to
seeing older people eating food which is refused
them, they will take the denial of certain
articles as a matter of course, and rarely
think of entering a protest. They will learn
that hot bread and griddle-cakes are not
meant for little boys and girls, and will take
abstinence from meat at breakfast or in the
evening, and fried foods or rich desserts at
all times, as a matter of course.</p>

<p class="i1">At noon, which should be their dinner-time,
a more varied diet is permissible. Then
there may be soup and some kind of meat for
the older children—chicken, rare roast beef,
boiled or roast mutton, a piece of steak or a
chop—stews entirely freed from grease, potatoes,
sweet or white, or some other vegetable,
and a plain dessert. It is very little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
additional trouble to so regulate the bill of
fare that what makes the lunch of the
"grown-up" may embrace certain articles
that will suit the childish stomachs; or there
may be a little soup reserved from the dinner
of the evening before, a dish of some
carefully warmed-over vegetable, possibly a
little of last night's meat prepared in a mince
or stew, which will obviate the necessity of
cooking fresh food for the easily pleased
little ones. Often bread and apple-sauce,
stewed fruit, or a small portion of fruit jelly
or marmalade is as acceptable a dessert as
can be provided.</p>

<p class="i1">Having eaten these two meals with the
family, it is as well to let the younglings
have their simple tea by themselves before
the family dinner. A dish of soft toast, or a
bowl of bread and milk, or of crackers and
milk, or of rice and milk, and bread and butter,
are usually all they ought to have so
soon before their bedtime. They may have
a side table set in the dining-room, or a tray
may be carried to them in the nursery, and
the repast superintended by the mother or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
nurse. Sometimes papa will come home in
time to look in upon his little folks at their
final meal, and to help them to settle it afterwards
by a romp. Knowing no other mode
of life, the children will rarely think of questioning
the judgment that sends them to bed
early after their light supper, instead of permitting
them to sit up to a late, heavy, and
indigestible course dinner.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_FAMILY_TEA" id="THE_FAMILY_TEA"></a>THE FAMILY TEA</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_a.jpg"
    alt="Letter A" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A PLEASANT feature of domestic life
which is done away with by the late dinner
is the family tea. This meal, always an
informal one, used to give play to the housekeeper's
fancy in the concoction of dainty
dishes with which to render the repast more
appetizing to the tired and hungry master of
the home. Now, to be sure, she has lunches
upon which to expend her culinary ingenuity;
but then the person for whom she best loves
to cater, her husband, is rarely at home.</p>

<p class="i1">In some families it is the custom to have
tea one night in the week. It may be on
Saturday, when there is no school and the
children can all be at home to an early dinner,
or on Sunday, when many people dine
in the middle of the day. Still other households
prefer a noon dinner and a simple tea
in summer, pleading the advantage of getting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
the heavy cookery out of the way in the
morning, instead of being obliged to stand
over a cook-stove through the long blazing
afternoon.</p>

<p class="i1">In one way or another, then, there are few
families where the tea-table is not spread at
least once a week, while in many homes it
is a daily institution. It only ceases to be
delightful when it is, through carelessness,
allowed to slip into a groove, and when the
suggestion of making it attractive is put
aside with the excuse, "Oh, anything will do
for tea!"</p>

<p class="i1">Some years ago a party of city people
spent a charming summer in a farm-house
high up among the Berkshire hills. The accommodations
of the roomy old-fashioned
dwelling were good, the breakfasts and dinners
excellent, well cooked, and liberal in
provision. But the teas! Night after night
the guests gathered about a tea-table
adorned with plates of cold bread, of butter,
and of cake, pitchers of milk, and occasionally
a dish of berries or of stewed fruit. Tea
there was, as a matter of course, but never a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
bit of meat or fish, or an egg in any form,
boiled, poached, or in an omelet; not even a
pat of pot-cheese or a few slices of dairy
cheese. Warm biscuit, muffins, and waffles
were likewise conspicuous by their absence.</p>

<p class="i1">It was all very well for those who ate
bread and milk and were fond of cake, but
for a party of ravenous young people, who
had spent a long afternoon playing tennis,
fishing or driving, or tramping over the hills
in the hunger-provoking air, the sight of the
table was not inspiriting; nor did it become
more popular as the season advanced and the
early frosty evenings improved appetites
that had never been poor. Yet, in spite of
loudly expressed hints, it never seemed to
occur to the farmer's good wife that her tea-table
was not supplied with every viand the
most exacting eater could desire.</p>

<p class="i1">Naturally, when a hearty meal has been
served in the middle of the day, there should
be no thought of having to prepare a second
dinner for the evening. But there should be,
at least, some relish to vary the monotony of
plain bread and butter, something to give the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
meal an aspect other than that of a perfunctory
"feed," where every one eats on the
principle upon which Nicholas Nickleby
"distended his stomach with a bowl of porridge"
the morning after his arrival at
Dotheboys Hall—not that he wanted it
then, but lest he should be inconveniently
hungry when there was nothing to eat.</p>

<p class="i1">There are many delicious supper dishes
which are made with little difficulty. In
winter, oysters, clams, scallops, broiled ham,
fried, broiled, or stewed chicken, chicken
scallop or mince, sausages, bacon and eggs,
with any of the large varieties of griddle-cakes
or warm breads, will make a meal to
satisfy any one; while in summer, salads of
eggs, fish, lobsters, chicken, cold lamb or
veal, shrimp, cheese, beet leaves, lettuce,
cabbage, potato, string-beans, and of many
other kinds, may be relied upon. Omelets
and other preparations of eggs are inexpensive,
easily cooked, and generally popular,
while cold meat goes well on a summer
evening, especially when accompanied by
bannocks, scones, butter-cakes, toasted crackers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
wafers, or some light bread that is easily
made and not hard to digest. Then there
are galantines, potted meats, jellied fish,
pickled salmon, cottage-cheese, and numerous
other little delicacies that are not costly
and yet are good.</p>

<p class="i1">The table for tea should be set much as it
is for breakfast, with the exception of the
oatmeal sets. All the dishes may be placed
upon the table at once, as they would be at
lunch, and the family may do much of the
passing of plates. The tea is served with
the first course, and the cups and tray may
be removed to make room for the dish of
fruit or simple sweets that generally concludes
the meal. The saucers in which these
are served should stand on plates, on which
each guest may lay the cake which is usually
passed at the same time. Hot puddings are
out of place at tea, but instead there may be,
in winter, apple-sauce, stewed prunes, preserved
ginger, brandied and preserved
peaches, pears or plums, jams or marmalades,
custards, blanc-manges, jellies, or anything
of that sort; while in summer it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
rarely impossible to procure berries of some
kind, or other fruit. A dish of "bonny-clabber"—better
known, perhaps, as "loppered
milk"—of junket, or of syllabub is always
delicious, and is usually easily obtained
where milk and cream are plentiful.</p>

<p class="i1">No domestic sight is pleasanter in its way
than a tea-table on a cold winter night,
spread with a bright cloth and set out with
dainty china and shining silver, and with all
the cheer-inspiring appurtenances of the tea-tray;
with the plate of hot bread, the savory
dish of hot meat, and the little relishes that
housekeepers know well how to supply.
And in summer its counterpart is seen in the
table laid in the room brightened by the
level sun's rays, where a crisp salad, piles of
white and brown bread, and a plate of rusk
or tea-biscuit, pitchers of milk, and a dish of
berries with cream in abundance revive the
fainting appetites and spirits of those who
have borne the heat and burden of the day.</p>

<p class="i1">In summer a tea on the lawn is an agreeable
variety to introduce occasionally. A
medium-sized table may be carried out under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
the trees, and spread with a white cloth.
On this are placed the principal dishes—the
bread-and-butter, which may sometimes have
its place taken by sandwiches; the salad or
cold meat, or both; the cake and fruit. The
tea-tray and kettle may be here too, or the
tea may be made in the house. Iced tea and
coffee make a pleasant change once in a
while.</p>

<p class="i1">A rug or two may be laid on the grass if
any of the party have a nervous dread of
colds, and a few little tables will provide a
space upon which to rest a cup of tea or a
glass of milk when the lap is occupied by the
plate containing the more solid viands. Low
chairs should stand here and there, and the
whole scene will present a charmingly festal
appearance at a trifling outlay of time and
trouble.</p>

<p class="i1">A certain family who possess a delightful
country place make their Sunday evening <i>al
fresco</i> tea one of the pleasantest spots in the
week. No one is present but the family and
any guests who may be staying in the house.
The pretty, simple meal is served out on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
grassy lawn, which slopes down to the water.
When the eating is over, the maid comes
out, gathers the dishes into a tray, and carries
them back to the house, happy in the
thought that there is no supper-table to be
cleared and no dining-room to be brushed up.</p>

<p class="i1">Long after the vestiges of the feast have
been removed the family sit there, chatting
pleasantly, watching the sunset and the stars
coming out or the moon rising. By and by
some voice begins a hymn, the others take it
up, and the singing goes on until the early
bedtime comes, and the party turns towards
the house with a restful happiness that is
none the less deep and true because it is hard
to describe or to analyze.</p>

<h2><a name="AFTERNOON_TEA" id="AFTERNOON_TEA"></a>AFTERNOON TEA</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_a.jpg"
    alt="Letter A" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">AMONG the many English customs which
have been introduced into American society
there is none that sooner attained a
widespread popularity than afternoon tea—a
simple and easy form of entertainment,
that entailed little expense and less trouble
upon the hostess, and supplied a long-felt
want. Soon all over the land teas were the
rage, and in large cities and small villages
alike cards were flying about, bearing upon
them the name of the hostess, and in one corner,
"Tea at five o'clock" or "Tea from four
to six," as the case might be.</p>

<p class="i1">With the usual tendency of the citizens of
this great and glorious country to impress
upon the fashions borrowed from other nations
the stamp of their own individuality, it
was not long before the stereotyped tea,
bread-and-butter, and cake, which had at first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
made up the <i>menu</i> of these entertainments,
began to undergo modifications. First,
chocolate was added, on the plea that many
people do not care for tea. Bouillon came
next, and the use of this served as the basis
of that absurd report, instantly accepted by
foreigners, that the American young women
were so fragile in constitution as to be
obliged to brace themselves up with strong
beef tea at their receptions, in order to enable
them to perform their social duties. With
bouillon came sandwiches; next appeared
salad, and after that oysters, croquettes,
creams, ices, and charlottes followed one another
in rapid succession, until the metamorphosis
of the modest tea into the reception,
with its heavy party supper, was complete.</p>

<p class="i1">Part of this change may be attributed to
the display and love of competition which
are numbered among our national characteristics.
But at least a portion of the blame
must fall upon the participants in these entertainments,
who, not understanding that a
tea to be a tea must be simple, did not hesitate
to grumble at the trifling nature of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
refreshments there offered for their delectation.</p>

<p class="i1">"I am sick of your afternoon teas!"
grumbled one lord of creation, when informed
that the family had just received cards
to one of these affairs. "<i>I</i> like to go to a
place where you get something to eat besides
a cup of beef tea and a cracker, or tea
and bread-and-butter. It isn't the kind of
supper a hungry man wants when he comes
from his business. He needs something
hearty."</p>

<p class="i1">Ignorant and boorish though he was, he
voiced the sentiment of many of his sex,
who, owing to the training American society
has furnished in this respect, consider no
party a success unless the social enjoyments
are supplemented by a big "spread." In
England, where the dinner hour falls later
than it usually does in this country, the light
sustenance offered by afternoon tea serves as
a welcome break in the long stretch which
intervenes between luncheon and dinner.
Here a man who has his appetite whetted
for a six-o'clock repast cares little for a trifling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
refection at five or half after five. It
only serves to blunt his hunger without satisfying
it.</p>

<p class="i1">Of course, as soon as the tea was merged
into the virtual equivalent of an evening
party given in the daytime, its recommendation
as a cheap and convenient method of
entertaining one's friends vanished. While
one merely dropped in for a cup of tea on
the way home from calls or shopping, a plain
walking gown or visiting costume was perfectly
appropriate. But with the increased
formality of the tea arose the necessity for
richer dress, and the afternoon kettle-drum
became a kind of heterogeneous-looking assembly,
where, at five o'clock in the afternoon,
some of the women would appear in
evening gowns, with low necks and short
sleeves, and some in street suits, while the
men, of course, wore morning coats; although
in small towns the sight of men in
dress suits before six o'clock is an anomaly
too often witnessed.</p>

<p class="i1">Even apart from the matter of dress, other
difficulties and complications arose. Persons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
in moderate circumstances who had rejoiced
at the advent of the tea, because it
rendered feasible the gratification of their
hospitable instincts at an outlay within their
means, shrank back in dismay from this hybrid
form of assembly, declaring that it was
as easy to give a regular evening party, and
get the credit for that, as it was to receive
guests in a fashion which assumed simplicity,
but cost no less than an affair that made
more show.</p>

<p class="i1">A few women have had the courage to adhere
to what was the original design of the
afternoon tea, and to offer their guests only
the light refreshments suitable for this form
of entertaining. To such people the labor
connected with thus gathering their friends
about them is a trifling task. The hostess
sees that her rooms are in their best looks;
fills a few vases with fresh flowers, to give a
festal air; sets a round-table in her drawing-room
or library, or in the dining-room, if these
apartments are <i>en suite</i>; draws up her prettiest
cups and saucers and plates in battle
array, and invites a few young girls or intimate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
friends to assist her. They wear either
pretty house costumes or dainty tea gowns.
For refreshments are provided tea and chocolate,
possibly bouillon, bread-and-butter or
tiny sandwiches, and plenty of light cakes.
The eating is a secondary matter, the <i>raison
d'être</i> of the company being the desire for
pleasant social intercourse in an informal
fashion.</p>

<p class="i1">The woman who has a regular "at home"
or a weekly "afternoon tea" during the season
provides even less. She has tea or cocoa—rarely
both—bread-and-butter or fancy biscuit,
and cake. The toasted muffins or crumpets
and the many tea-cakes dear to the
British palate are little in vogue here, where
the dinner hour is almost invariably six or
half after six. Very few are the houses
where daily afternoon tea is the rule.</p>

<p class="i1">Numberless pretty adjuncts can be procured
to contribute to the attractiveness of
the kettle-drum. The tall crane, with its
brass, copper, or silver kettle, the daintily
embroidered tea and tray cloths, the fine
fringed or hem-stitched doilies, the exquisite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
china, the quaint teapot, the cozy, the odd
dishes for cake and biscuit—all afford opportunity
for the display of a cultured taste or
of a quick fancy. Nothing need be very
costly, but everything must be pretty, and
in this day the combination of beauty and
cheapness is by no means difficult or unusual.</p>

<p class="i1">The cards for an afternoon tea bear simply
the name of the hostess, and that of her
daughter if the latter is "out," and in the
corner is written or engraved "Tea" or
"At Home," and the day and the hour of
the entertainment. The card of any friend
who is visiting the hostess, or who entertains
with her, is enclosed in the same envelope.
If the invited guest cannot be present, she
sends her card, by post or by private hand,
so that it may reach the hostess upon the day
when she receives.</p>

<p class="i1">Those people who live in the country, or
who are so fortunate as to possess summer
places out of town, can give charming outdoor
teas, which far surpass in pleasantness
anything that can be devised in the city.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
We Americans live too much in the house,
and that, too, in a climate which offers great
facilities for a freer mode of life. A tea on
a lawn or veranda when the air is full of the
perfume of flowers and the country is in its
holiday trim is a delight to all those lucky
enough to be invited to it. For such a kettle-drum,
iced tea and lemonade or claret-cup,
sandwiches, and cake may be offered,
with berries or other fruits when these are
in season.</p>

<h2><a name="HIGH_TEA" id="HIGH_TEA"></a>HIGH TEA</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_f.jpg"
    alt="Letter F" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">FOR a small company the high tea is an
excellent form of entertainment. It is
not suitable for a large assembly, but when
a limited number of guests have been invited
to spend the evening in some such recreation
as card-playing, it is very pleasant to ask
them first to high tea. Or if the latter part
of the evening is to be devoted to dancing, a
chosen few of the guests may be invited to
tea first, and the remainder requested to
come later. In that case no supper should
be offered to the dancers except cake, ices,
and coffee.</p>

<p class="i1">Should the dining-table be large enough
to accommodate all the guests bidden to the
high tea, it may be drawn to the requisite
length, and all the company seated about it.
But if, from the limited dimensions of the
dining-room, or because it better suits the
fancy of the hostess, small tables are preferred,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
these may be laid so as to accommodate
at each six, or four, or even two, always
taking care in the last case that the right
two are placed together.</p>

<p class="i1">If one large table is used, it may be spread
with either a dinner or a tea cloth. Flowers
should be in the middle upon a pretty centre-piece,
and there may be small vases set about
here and there. Individual bouquets are not
at all necessary. The places should be arranged
as usual, with small silver for each
course, and the usual accompaniments of
butter-plates—or of bread-and-butter plates—salt-cellars,
glasses, napkins, etc. If it is
warm weather, the table may be further
beautified by the bowls or baskets of fresh
fruits that are to make part of the dessert,
and, in winter, dishes of cake, of preserved
or brandied fruits, etc., may be on the table.
Should the hostess prefer, however, these
may be placed on the sideboard, thus allowing
space for the more substantial viands,
which at a tea are seldom relegated to the
position on the side-table that they would
take at dinner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">At the head of the table sits the hostess,
with the tea-tray in front of her. It by no
means follows, however, because this repast
is called a tea that the Chinese herb should
be <i>en évidence</i>. If the party is composed
chiefly of young people, the chances are
strongly in favor of their preference being
for coffee or chocolate. They may be offered
their choice of these beverages, which the
hostess pours out, the servant passing them
with cream and sugar, that each may add of
these to suit himself. Russian tea may possibly
be offered, but even this is apt to be
less popular than either chocolate or coffee.</p>

<p class="i1">Should small tables be used, the hostess
may preside over a tray placed upon one of
them, or, when it seems more convenient,
the cups may be filled outside, and passed to
each with the cream-pitcher and sugar-bowl.
It saves some delay in serving if there are a
cream-pitcher and sugar-bowl on each table.
These little tables may be covered with small
cloths or large napkins, and need have nothing
else upon them beyond the necessary
furniture for each place, except, perhaps, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
vase of flowers. While small tables are
often admirable as accommodating more
people with comfort than could be seated at
a large table, yet the latter gives opportunity
for a prettier display of floral decoration,
china, silver, etc., than is afforded by the
former.</p>

<p class="i1">The bill of fare is easily arranged. There
are no raw oysters or clams, as at a lunch or
dinner; and while bouillon may be provided,
it is not at all necessary. The meal may begin
with oysters in some form, as fricasseed,
fried, broiled, steamed, or panned, or in croquettes.
With them are passed bread-and-butter
(brown or graham bread cut thin is
good with oysters) or rolls. The plates are
then removed, and the next course brought
in. This may consist of chicken—broiled or
fried—or broiled birds, or French chops, and
of potatoes in some form, as <i>à la parisienne</i>,
French fried, or hashed with cream and
browned. Cold tongue or ham is sometimes
also passed at this time, and warm bread in
some shape, as French rolls, sally-lunn, tea-biscuit,
rusk, or waffles. The coffee or chocolate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
is also served at this stage in the proceedings.</p>

<p class="i1">After this course comes a salad—lettuce
and tomato mayonnaise, or chicken, lobster,
or salmon—fresh plates being served for this,
as a matter of course. Olives and some fancy
cheese—Brie, Roquefort, or Gorgonzola—usually
come with the salad. Cheese at this
stage is strongly recommended by the epicure;
but it is not essential, except to those
who hold, in the words of the old doggerel,
that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse">"A dinner (or supper) without cheese</div>
    <div class="verse">Is like a kiss without a squeeze."</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="i1">The table is now cleared, and the dessert
brought in. This may be quite simple, as,
say, preserved or brandied fruit with fancy
cakes; or it may be more elaborate, and comprise
jelly, charlotte-russe, or fresh fruit of
some kind, and light cakes. Ices are not
strictly <i>en règle</i>, although no canon of taste
is seriously offended if they are offered. It
is better, however, to serve them later in the
evening. Still, they are not essential even
then. Finger-bowls set on doilies laid on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
pretty plates must be passed the last thing
before the guests quit the table.</p>

<p class="i1">Of course the <i>menu</i> suggested above may
be altered to suit the season and the taste of
the entertainer. Lobster or crabs, clams or
shrimps, may be substituted for the oysters.
Green pease may accompany chops, or sweetbreads
may be the principal meat dish of
the second course. Roast duck, turkey, or
chicken may be provided if broilers are out
of season, or birds may be served with a lettuce
or celery salad for the third course.
And when one reflects upon the fancy dishes
which may be prepared for dessert—the
blanc-manges, the jellied fruits, the Spanish
or Bavarian or Hamburg creams, the charlottes
of divers kinds, the whips, custards,
and syllabubs—the only difficulty that arises
is where to choose.</p>

<p class="i1">A pretty notion is to introduce some unexpected
feature into the high tea which will
appeal to the imaginations of the guests as
well as to their palates. A little ingenuity
will suggest some novelty of this sort. The
literary salad, which has become well known
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
in certain localities, may yet be unfamiliar
in others. This is made by cutting a number
of slips of paper, writing on each one a
prose or poetic quotation, and attaching each
strip to a leaf of pale green tissue-paper, cut
and crimped into the fashion of a lettuce
leaf. Different shades of the paper should
be selected, so that the tints may blend as
they do in a veritable head of lettuce. These
leaves are then arranged in a bowl, and at
some point in the meal, usually just before
the dessert, the bowl is passed, and each
guest draws out at random two or three of
the leaves. The endeavor then is to guess
the authorship of the different quotations,
and a prize is usually offered to the one
who guesses the greatest number correctly.
The prize may be the bowl or dish in which
the salad is served. Or, instead of quotations,
conundrums may be written on the
slips, and puzzling out their answers usually
affords a great deal of amusement.</p>

<p class="i1">A bright young hostess, who was always
bubbling over with new and charming ideas,
hit upon the clever one of having her guests'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
characters told by chirosophy. She obtained
a specimen of the handwriting of each of
those whom she had invited, and sent the
samples to a specialist, who deduced from
each an estimate of the characteristics of its
writer. The verdicts thus obtained were
enclosed each in an envelope bearing the
name of the person whose peculiar bias was
therein described. The envelopes were then
bound with ribbons, tied, and sealed. One
was laid at the place of each guest at the
table, and after providing a fruitful source of
wonder and comment during the early part
of the meal, the seals were broken when the
fruit was passed. Each read aloud the statement
contained in her envelope, and it was
curious and amusing to observe with what
accuracy many idiosyncrasies and singular
traits of disposition had been indicated.</p>

  SOME HINTS ABOUT SUPPER</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_i.jpg"
    alt="Letter I" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IN these days of theatre and opera parties
the matter of late suppers assumes more
importance than it possessed in the time
when these amusements were less universally
popular. Upon the occasions when a young
man escorted his "best girl" to the play or
the concert, he took her afterwards, as a natural
sequence, to a restaurant, where they
partook of some such light refreshment as
ice-cream, cake, and coffee, this style of supper
being varied sometimes by the introduction
of oysters in one form or another. But
when a company of young people go to the
theatre nowadays, and return afterwards to
the house of their chaperon or of some other
member of the party, they are usually hungry
with the healthy appetite that it is no
longer the foolish fashion to conceal.</p>

<p class="i1">The members of whist clubs, of literary or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
dramatic circles, of small dancing classes, of
amateur orchestras, and of a variety of other
similar social organizations, feel a like desire
for food after an evening's busy occupation,
while even in the family the sensible custom
is gaining ground of eating something not
long before retiring—a something which, if
not equal in extent and weight to the late
supper of our English cousins, is yet more
substantial than the caramels and chocolate
creams with which school-girls, and often
their seniors, solace the hunger that is apt to
attack them about bedtime.</p>

<p class="i1">When one gives only an occasional reception
or evening party it is taken for granted
that the refreshments will be rather elaborate
in their nature. But when the meetings
of a club of any sort are of weekly, fortnightly,
or even monthly recurrence, the expense
becomes an object. There may be
some members of the body to whom the disbursement
of a few dollars more or less is a
matter of trivial moment, but there is very
rarely any club of this sort where there are
not some who would feel seriously the cost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
of entertaining in a showy fashion. For the
sake of these weak brothers or sisters, a
certain amount of consideration should be
shown, and no display made by the wealthy
ones which would throw into the shade the
simpler entertainment which is all many
can afford to offer. A supper need not be
poor because it is not costly, but it must
make up in daintiness and unusualness for
what it lacks in price.</p>

<p class="i1">A chief object to be sought in planning
these suppers is to select something which
can be made ready beforehand, so that the
hostess can enjoy her evening without being
handicapped in her pleasure-seeking by the
thought of possible complications arising in
the preparation of the supper which may require
her absence from the room. Unless
she has a practised cook, she should not attempt
dishes of oysters, or of anything of
the kind which demands careful supervision
at the last moment. Instead of this, she
should content herself with chocolate or
coffee and bouillon for the hot items of her
<i>menu</i>, and for the rest take her choice from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
among the many salads and other cold dishes
which are generally popular. Cold chicken
or duck, jellied tongue or fowl, or a really
fine galantine, or a dish of salad, and rolls or
sandwiches at discretion, may be chosen.
For sweets, ices are always excellent if they
can be procured; or if not, there are jellies,
which, with whipped cream and light cakes,
coffee, or chocolate, are quite enough—indeed,
more than enough in many cases.
Often sandwiches, cake, and coffee are sufficient;
but let the sandwiches be of something
besides ham and tongue, the cake be
light and delicious, and the coffee strong and
clear, and served with whipped cream.</p>

<p class="i1">If hot dishes are indispensable, something
should be selected like chicken or sweetbread
pâtés, or lobster in some form, which will not
be injured by warming over. Croquettes too,
if properly prepared, are delicious, but they
must be soft and creamy inside, not hard like
sausage balls.</p>

<p class="i1">For the home supper the preparations are
much simpler. This late repast may consist
merely of a plate of crackers, or of light biscuit,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
or of bread-and-butter, with perhaps a
tin of potted meat, or a few sardines, or a
piece of cheese, or a box of guava jelly, or
a little fruit. Iced water, or milk and Apollinaris,
or Seltzer are the best beverages to
serve, or, for those who like it, a bottle of
ale or beer.</p>

<p class="i1">In the hope of aiding housekeepers who
desire to prepare something a little different
from the stereotyped suppers so common at
evening entertainments, and which usually
consist of oysters, chicken or lobster salad,
sandwiches, ice-cream, and coffee, there are
appended a few recipes for dishes perhaps
less commonly known than those just mentioned.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Lobster Salmi.</i>—Two cups boiled lobster
(<i>cut</i>, not chopped, into small pieces), three
eggs (the yolks only), two tablespoonfuls
butter, half a pint of cream, one wine-glassful
sherry, one tablespoonful brandy, Cayenne
pepper and salt to taste, one teaspoonful
lemon juice. Put the lobster over the fire in
a double boiler with the butter, wine, brandy,
pepper, and salt; let it become smoking hot.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
It will not injure it to stand covered at the
back of the stove for some time. Just before
it is to be served bring the water in the
outer vessel to the boiling-point, and stir into
the scalding hot lobster the beaten yolks of
the eggs and the cream. Let this stand one
minute longer on the fire, remove, add the
lemon juice, and serve at once in small silver
or china shells or in nappies.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>French Fish Salad.</i>—Select some firm
white-fish (halibut is excellent for this purpose),
and boil. When perfectly cold cut it
into neat slices; on each slice lay a sardine,
and arrange the fish upon and among crisp
lettuce leaves. Prepare a mayonnaise dressing,
and into a half-pint of it stir three sardines
rubbed smooth with the back of a fork.
Pass the sauce in a pitcher containing a spoon
or small ladle, that each guest may help himself.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Lobster Mayonnaise Sandwiches.</i>—Into
half a cupful of finely minced lobster stir
two tablespoonfuls of mayonnaise dressing.
Season to taste with Cayenne pepper and
salt, with a little lemon juice if it seems to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
be needed. Select bread a day old for this
purpose, butter it light on the loaf, and cut
very thin. Spread a slice with the mixture,
and lay another buttered slice upon it, face
downward. Cut into small neat squares or triangles.
The crust is sometimes trimmed off.</p>

<p class="i1">Chicken mayonnaise sandwiches may be
made in the same way, rejecting all bits of
skin or gristle, and omitting the lemon juice.
Ham, tongue, and shrimp mayonnaise sandwiches
are also good prepared in similar
fashion.</p>

<p class="i1"><i>Veal Galantine.</i>—Select a breast of veal
about eighteen inches long by twelve wide,
and remove from it all bits of bone or gristle.
Spread the inside of it with a layer of sausage
meat, or of salt or corned pork finely chopped,
and highly seasoned with minced onion,
parsley, and sweet-herbs. Upon this lay a
few thin slices of cold boiled ham and tongue
and several strips of raw veal. Spread
these with more of the force-meat, taking
care not to bring it too near the edges, as it
would then squeeze out when the galantine
is rolled. Sprinkle chopped herbs and onion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
over the inside, and roll up the piece of veal,
the force-meat inside. Bind and skewer into
shape, sew it up in a stout cloth, and place it
in a pot containing a hock of pork or a
knuckle of veal well cracked, a bouquet of
herbs, a sliced onion, a sliced carrot, and two
or three stalks of celery. Cover all with cold
water, and let the pot, after coming gradually
to a boil, simmer at the back of the
stove for at least four hours. Remove the pot
from the fire, and let the galantine become
cold in the liquor; then take it out, tighten
the bandage about it, and place under a
heavy weight for several hours; uncover,
and surround with aspic jelly. To make
this, clear the liquor in which the galantine
was cooked by bringing it to a boil with the
white and crushed shell of a freshly broken
egg, straining it, as soon as the scum rises to
the top, through a piece of thick cotton cloth.
Season a quart of the clear liquid thus left
with a wineglass of sherry, two tablespoonfuls
of vinegar, pepper and salt to taste.
While boiling hot dissolve in it an ounce of
gelatine which has been previously soaked in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
cold water for an hour. Pour a little of the
jelly into a brick-shaped mould large enough
to hold the galantine, first wetting the mould
with cold water, and when the jelly forms
lay the galantine on this. Pour the remaining
jelly over it, and let it stand in a cold
place until firm. Turn all out of the mould,
and serve garnished with lettuce leaves.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THAT housekeeper must be a noteworthy
exception to the majority of the members
of that honorable body whose heart
does not yearn to possess a goodly store of
china and glass. She may begin her married
life with the resolve to content herself
with very little, but she will find, in this form
of acquisition as in nearly every other, that
appetite comes with eating, and the more she
has the more she wants. Curiously enough,
she learns also that although she may get
along very comfortably for a long while
without certain articles, she has not owned
them a month without reaching a state of
mind where she cannot understand how she
ever managed to keep house lacking the new
possessions.</p>

<p class="i1">In these days a bride is usually pretty well
supplied with handsome china and glass by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
the friends who send them to her as wedding
presents. She receives from them at least
the luxuries of table furniture, if not the necessities.
Among her gifts she has almost
always one or more fine cut-glass bowls or
dishes, and possibly several small bonbon,
pickle, or olive saucers. An ice-cream set is
also a favorite gift, and the bride usually receives
also a set of after-dinner coffee cups
and saucers and at least a dozen fruit-plates.
A few young couples are so fortunate as to
number a complete dinner set among their
presents; and they may deem themselves
lucky indeed, for the cost of this necessary
purchase makes a big hole in the sum that
the bride received, or that she has laid aside
for household plenishing.</p>

<p class="i1">Of course there are some young married
people to whom money is, so to speak, no
object, who have but to go to a shop and
order whatever pleases their fancy. But
they are few and far between. To most
newly made housekeepers the filling of their
china closets must be slow work, and each
new addition is generally the evidence of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
bit of economy or good management, or else
a memento of some Christmas or holiday,
and all the more valued on that account.
Even when the proud young manager is beginning
to view with pride the accumulation
of months, she is sadly liable to find their
ranks lessened some woful day by one of
those accidents which will happen so long
as china and glass are breakable commodities.
The cheese-dish, the berry-bowl, or the
cake-plate has come to grief in Bridget's or
Gretchen's or Dinah's hands.</p>

<p class="i1">"Shure, ma'am, it jist slipped out of me
hands as I was a-wipin' it," or, "It came in
two pieces when I put it into the wather.
Feth an' it must have been cracked before."</p>

<p class="i1">Of course a dish will get broken occasionally.
Once in a while one will go to pieces
even under the careful touch of the mistress,
and no hireling can be taught to handle fragile
things as carefully as will their owner.
A potent aid in inculcating caution is the
habit of deducting from a servant's wages
the price of the pieces broken. This rule
should not be enforced in the case of a really
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
careful maid, but only with one who
shows a decided tendency to heedlessness.
Even with this penalty there will be chips
and cracks that will prove almost as great a
trial to the mistress as a total fracture. To
the importance of these minor accidents the
average serving-maid seems serenely unconscious.</p>

<p class="i1">"Norah, if I treated you as you deserve, I
would take the value of this out of your
wages," said a mistress, ruefully contemplating
a Limoges chocolate pot, from the lip of
which a triangular fragment had been neatly
chipped.</p>

<p class="i1">"Indade, ma'am, an' can't ye use it as
well as iver ye did?" was the surprised reply.</p>

<p class="i1">Without going as far as one woman, who
used to declare she would rather have a piece
of china completely smashed than to see it
cracked, one may safely say that the good
housekeeper never perceives even a trifling
breakage in any piece of her table-ware
without a real pang at heart. To avert
these accidents she is wise if she intrusts to
no hands but her own or those of an exceptionally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
careful maid the cleansing of her
most precious belongings of porcelain and
crystal. Sometimes, however, a woman's
other duties are so pressing that she cannot
spare the time to wash the delicate dishes
which she prides herself upon having in constant
use, and then she must simply make up
her mind to be resigned to the losses she
must sustain if she permits her servants to
take entire charge of these breakables.</p>

<p class="i1">Without using unsightly stone-ware, it is
yet possible to procure for every-day service
pretty crockery that is less easily broken
than the delicate French china. In purchasing
a dinner set which is to do steady duty,
the housewife must be guided by prudential
as well as artistic considerations. She can
find what is known as the English Dresden
and one or two other kinds of china which
combine pretty designs with durability of
material, and are not very expensive.</p>

<p class="i1">Often there are included in a dinner set a
full dozen each of tea, breakfast coffee, and
after-dinner coffee cups; and sometimes the
set can be purchased to greater advantage by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
taking them all. Frequently, too, the dealer
will not break the set. Unless either or both
of these conditions should prevail, there is
little gain for the housekeeper in taking the
whole set. Usually she already has a fair
number of cups and saucers, and in any case
she would not need as many as the set comprises.
By a little search it is often practicable
to pick up a broken set, consisting
of a certain number of plates, vegetable and
meat dishes, and in this day there is no obligation
upon one to have everything to
match. The principal pieces should be alike,
if possible; but the fish, salad, dessert, and
fruit plates may all be of different designs,
and be none the worse on that account.</p>

<p class="i1">Her dinner dishes purchased, the young
mistress may congratulate herself. There is
no other equally heavy pull ahead of her in
the line of china. Now she may at her leisure
pick up her pretty harlequin set of cups
and saucers, her dessert dishes, her large
cake and bread plates, and her small bread
and butter plates, her fish set, her chocolate-pot,
her bouillon-cups, her nappies, her individual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
dishes for shirred eggs, for scalloped
fish, oysters, or chicken, and the dozen of
other dainty fancies with which the china
shops are crowded. Her accumulations will
be all the dearer to her because many of
them have been procured at the cost of a little
personal sacrifice.</p>

<p class="i1">When one begins to price cut glass she is
generally wofully discouraged. The cost of
the plainest cut is very high if the glass is
heavy, and a little experience soon teaches
the housekeeper that it is very poor economy
to buy the thin glass for every-day use. It
will often break in washing in spite of the
most careful handling, and a slight blow to
it means fracture. Now that pressed glass
comes in such pretty patterns, it may be
made to do duty for common use, and is so
attractive that no one need be ashamed to
put it on her table.</p>

<p class="i1">"You should see my new glass dish," said
a young housekeeper, gleefully. "It cost
me just seventy-nine cents, and when you
set it on handsome damask it looks like the
real cut. Of course you can't put two cheap
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
things together, but my table-cloths are all
so good that I can afford to set a few imitations
on them."</p>

<p class="i1">The advantages of this heavy glass are
seen less in the dishes, large and small, than
in the goblets or tumblers that are in daily
use. Here the havoc is dreadful when the
glass is of the egg-shell species. Cheap
though it often is, it does not pay to purchase
it when its destruction is merely a
question of a few days or weeks.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_e.jpg"
    alt="Letter E" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">EVEN at the best, securing a provision of
table linen is bound to be a heavy expense.
Whatever economies the housekeeper
may practise by purchasing Japanese or
stout English porcelain, and pressed glass, she
will never find that it pays to buy cheap
damask. It does not look well even at the
first, and it is worse after each washing. No
matter how handsome may be the china, silver,
and glass put upon it, a sleazy damask
will give a cheap appearance to the whole
table.</p>

<p class="i1">On the other hand, really good linen pays
by its wearing qualities for the original outlay.
If it is not allowed to become so dirty
before it is washed that hard rubbing is required
to make it clean, it will last for years.
The first tiny breaks must be carefully
watched for and repaired at once. By such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
precautions even a cloth which is in daily
service may be made to last several years.
Above all, no washing-soda, no bleaching
preparation of any kind, must ever be used
upon it. It may whiten the linen at first,
but the small holes with which the damask
will soon be riddled will tell more plainly
than words the harm the fabric has sustained
from the alkali. Should the linen become
yellow, it may be whitened by being laid on
the grass in the dew or rain first, and afterwards
in the sunshine.</p>

<p class="i1">Linen should never be put away damp, as
it is almost certain to mildew. These spots
may sometimes be removed or lessened by
boiling the stained linen in buttermilk, or by
the use of Javelle water, but it is a difficult
and doubtful task.</p>

<p class="i1">A young housekeeper does not need a
large supply of table linen at the beginning
of her career. Of course it is very delightful
to her to feel that her sideboard drawers
are so thoroughly stocked that they will not
need to be replenished for years to come;
and if she has had a long engagement in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
which to make her preparations, or if she has
followed the wise old-fashioned custom of
beginning a linen chest while yet a young
girl, she may be able to rejoice in a generous
assortment of table-cloths, napkins, and doilies.
Or possibly some kindly relative or
friend has given her a check to be expended
in this fashion; or she may have a wealthy
father whose liberality relieves her from the
necessity of economizing in this direction.</p>

<p class="i1">Taking it for granted, however, that every
dollar counts, the young wife must consider
seriously just what she will need. If she expects
to entertain a good deal of company,
she will have to lay in a large supply of
linen. But if she intends to live in comparative
quiet, not giving many luncheons or dinner
parties, even although always ready to
receive her own or her husband's friends,
she will find that she can manage comfortably
without a large quantity of napery. In
a family where there are few children, and
where ordinary care is observed, it is quite
practicable, barring accidents, to get along
easily with but one white table-cloth a week.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
In this case, of course, a colored cloth must
be used for breakfast and lunch or for breakfast
and tea. If the bare table is used at
lunch, the housekeeper may manage to make
shift with one breakfast cloth, with the accompanying
dozen napkins. If she can possibly
afford it, however, she should buy two
colored cloths and two dozen colored napkins.
For dinner use she must provide two
white cloths with the napkins to match.
These cloths may be about two and a quarter
or two and a half yards long. Besides
these, she should have one handsomer white
cloth a little longer, to use when she wishes
to entertain several guests. There is no reason
in her purchasing the long table-cloths
that range from twelve to sixteen feet in
length, unless she has a very large dining-room
and anticipates an occasional family
party, which will oblige her to use the table
in its most extended form.</p>

<p class="i1">To buy table-cloth damask by the yard is
cheaper than to purchase the cloth in one
piece. The designs are often very pretty,
but the separate cloth is usually more satisfactory.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
Large flaring patterns are out of
place on a small table. Such designs as the
old and always pleasing snow-drop pattern,
or a little block or diamond, or ivy or fern
leaves, or small stars or shells, one does not
weary of so soon as of something more
showy. It is not worth while to purchase a
cloth chiefly on account of its attractive border,
for this is seldom seen. The centre figures
are those which receive the most attention.</p>

<p class="i1">In doing up table-cloths there should always
be a suspicion of starch used, but there
should be none in the napkins.</p>

<p class="i1">With the provision of table-linen described
above and a set of fruit napkins, the housekeeper
will be able to manage very easily.
Of course she will desire tray cloths, sideboard
covers, centre-pieces, doilies, and the
like, but these may be made by her own fingers.
The costliness of these consists in the
work bestowed upon them, and they can be
made at home for half or less than half the
price asked for them in the shops. By working
them herself play is given to the ingenuity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
of her fancy, and she may have the
pleasure of knowing that she has something
different from what every one else can
buy.</p>

<p class="i1">The housewife can hardly have too many
doilies. Not only are they useful to put under
finger-bowls, and to lay on cake and
bread plates, but they are admirable to place
under hot dishes, to lay between a scallop-shell
and the plate, under pâtés, etc. And
when the home mistress has enough of these,
she may set to work to provide herself with
carving-cloths, corn and biscuit napkins, and
the many other pretty pieces of table linen
that are always in demand.</p>

<p class="i1">There is very seldom a bride who does not
receive enough small silver, such as forks and
spoons, to supply her own table. If she is
not so fortunate, however, she should, if possible,
try to buy solid silver, even if she can
afford to get but half a dozen pieces of each
kind. Should this be beyond her means, she
will find plated silver in neat designs, although
it will in time wear out, while the
solid silver will last a lifetime or longer. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
never pays to buy thin silver, for this bends
and dents easily.</p>

<p class="i1">Some people who own solid small silver
lock it up except upon rare occasions, and
use only plated ware when <i>en famille</i>, affirming
that the peace of mind thus gained is
worth more than the luxury of using real
silver. In this matter every one must judge
for herself; but if a vote were taken the
chances are that those who use the solid silver
would testify that its care costs them very
little time or thought. The simple expedient
of counting it two or three times a week is
generally sufficient to insure its safety, and
the duty of carrying it up-stairs at night is
too trifling to deserve mention.</p>

<p class="i1">Those who have ever been so fortunate as
to possess plated silver vegetable dishes or a
soup tureen would never willingly use those
of china. Not only do the silver vessels
keep their contents hot, but they are not
breakable, and a dent may be remedied at a
small cost. They are not hard to keep clean.
A plunge into clean scalding water, and a
quick wiping afterwards, whenever they have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
been used, with an occasional rubbing with a
piece of flannel or chamois-skin, will generally
keep them bright.</p>

<p class="i1">Whenever silver, solid or plated, needs a
thorough cleaning, electro-silicon may be
used; and after the scouring has been done
with a brush dipped in the powder, the
pieces should be rinsed off in scalding water
containing a little ammonia, and well rubbed
with flannel. Even the most tarnished silver
may be brightened by this means.</p>

<div class="smaller">
<p class="i1">If we ever get as much as $500 a year we shall purchase
this book and live like a prince.... It goes carefully through
the expenses of daily living, and indicates the thousand and
one ways in which a penny can be saved and another penny
put where it will do most good. A book of this kind placed
in the hands of those who have very limited means will show
that they can live very comfortably and have quite enough
to eat on a very small sum.—<i>N. Y. Herald.</i></p>

<p class="i1">It is a helpful working book, sensible and practical, and
tells how to buy, cook, and serve all sorts of food; how to
can, pickle, and preserve; and how to arrange and serve
luncheons, dinners, and teas, all in the most economical manner
consistent with appetizing results.—<i>Sunday-School Times</i>, Philadelphia.</p>

<p class="i1">Food-economist, cook-book, and instructor in table service
all in one.... The book is a capital one, and every housekeeper
should feel grateful to the able and painstaking author.—<i>N.
Y. Post.</i></p>

<p class="i1">The production of a lady who understands her subject
thoroughly, and who earnestly wishes to help others towards
the same useful knowledge.... A book of this sort (and
Miss Corson is the best able to produce it of any one we
know) is a great aid, and the more it is circulated the more
households will be made happy.—<i>Churchman</i>, N. Y.</p>

<p class="i1">Every housekeeper, whether coming within the scope of
the author's effort or not, will find many instructive hints, a
due regard for which will be conducive to the improved physical
well-being and increased mental serenity of the various
members of her household.—<i>St. Louis Republican.</i></p>

<p class="indent1_5">Manners and Social Usages in America. A Book
of Etiquette. By Mrs. <span class="sc">John Sherwood</span>. pp. 448.
New and Enlarged Edition, Revised by the Author.
16mo, Extra Cloth, $1 25.</p>

<div class="smaller">
<p class="i1">Mrs. Sherwood's admirable little volume differs from ordinary
works on the subject of etiquette, chiefly in the two facts
that it is founded on its author's personal familiarity with the
usages of really good society, and that it is inspired by good-sense
and a helpful spirit.... We think Mrs. Sherwood's little
book the very best and most sensible one of its kind that
we ever saw.—<i>N. Y. Commercial Advertiser.</i></p>

<p class="i1">We have no hesitation in declaring it to be the best work

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
